            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The Apologie did but tell men with as gracious words and as much sweetnesse as a thing could speak, how farre they did recede from, and disclaim <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Brownisme;</hi> and how neer they did <hi>accedere</hi> cloze with the present reformed Churches, even beyond the expectation of thousands, and see how many stinging flyes are and about to alight upon this youngling newly eaned. One buzzing to the other, as one Raven inviting another, at this lambing-time of the yeer, that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:196665:3"/> young brood, at the same minute may see the light and loose their eyes.</p>
                  <p>How many Replyes in two or three weeks, appearingly have turned the world, if not the Church, upside down; most men seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be resolved before the Arguments are solved?</p>

Just like that Hare that running through the Army that besieged</hi> Rome <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the Souldiers so lowdly to now her, that the Romanes thought verily that their works were stormed, and their City taken.</hi> But away. <hi>Non est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniens luctibus ista loqui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The title of the book in the title page and the first page is, <hi>Some Observations, Annotations, and Generall Considerations upon the Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Narration, humbly submitted to the Honorable Houses of Parliament, the most reverend and learned Divines of the Assembly, and all the Protestant Churches here in this Island, and abroad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A title carrying a great breadth with it, and soaring high, as if <hi>A. S.</hi> were confident that in his book he speaks <hi>learnedly,</hi> as a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, <hi>truly,</hi> as an honest man, <hi>gravely,</hi> as a serious man, and <hi>lovingly</hi> as a Christian man; and that all these wayes he did make good that title, which if it be shaped to the book, and read according to the rode thereof, I speak it seriously and with a sad heart (these being no times nor things for jesting or jeering, which is the faults of <hi>A. S.)</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment man said A. S. jeer'd. Another gentleman said, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not the spirit of the man, yet neither of them Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents.</note> may most justly be read thus: <hi>In Observations and in considerations simply committed against the Honorable Houses of Parliament, the reverend Assembly of Divines, and the Protestant Churches at home and abroad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this one single simple <hi>A. S.</hi> now starts up by himself, peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:196665:3"/> to state, and determine the Questions, for the resolution whereof the Parliament thought the Assembly of Divines few enough to undertake; and therefore call'd all them together for that purpose, who are now most intent upon the pin of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie; yet as if <hi>A. S.</hi> would take the work out of their hands, he will anticipate, and fore-judge the five Ministers as utterly erring throughout (for he sifts them corn after corn) which if true, the dispute is at an end. Go then <hi>A. S.</hi> and carrie, if you dare, your plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Parliament, and intreat the learned Assembly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>A. S.</hi> will go his own way, and thereby he hath given great offence to the <hi>Protestant Churches,</hi> to charge them all of dissenting from the five Ministers, and awakning mens spirits into replyes, when before they were drowsing with long expectation these two yeers of a publick determination, and I wish this may be the last Reply before all things be sweetly composed. However this intends onely to take off aspersions, not to lay down assertions. We will but barely answer <hi>A. S.</hi> who hath so lasht the five Ministers, with so much sharpnesse of spirit, for telling the world <hi>how farre off they are from Brownisme and Separation, and how close they come to the more reformed Churches in Scotland and England.</hi> Many very good men have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that the five Ministers closed so much; yet <hi>A. S.</hi> is bitterly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie they close no more, before the point be disputed. O it was a fault of the Cynick Phylosopher in his high shooes so to dance on the Platonick Phylosophers bed and Arras Coverlet, with boasting, that <hi>he danced on his brother Philosophers pride,</hi> as that the patient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher could justly reply, yea, saith he, <hi>Thou dancest on my pride with thy greater pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How much of this is <hi>A. S.</hi> his, I say not; but sure it was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonablest if not the most unsavourie book to multitudes of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall palates, as ever wise man put forth.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>James Cranford</hi> is quoted by the Printer in the page before the Title, as approving it and the book with a Licentious approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in these words; <hi>These judicious Observations and Annotations, &amp;c. as being at this time necessarie and seasonable for the vindication of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches, defending the authority of Parliaments and Synods, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of division amongst our selves, (though I reverence the persons of the Apologists, yet) I approve to be impressed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cranford,</hi> if the Printer hath dealt faithfully with you, let me intreat you (and the Lord help you) to see your self, ask your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:196665:4"/> aske your reason, aske the book it selfe, whether there be one true clause in all that you have said?</p>
                  <p>Are these Observations, &amp;c. of <hi>A. S. judicious,</hi> that are extra judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and prejudicall to the publike peace and order, and ordinance for dispute, prejudging and adjudging them, who joyntly with the grave Assembly, <hi>A. S.</hi> acknowledgeth the Arbitratour, or Judge, if not his Judge, in the matters in question? Are they at this time <hi>necessary,</hi> when the grave Commissioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had with farre more prudence and soliditie then <hi>A. S.</hi> said by way of reply so much to the Apologie, <hi>Nemine reclamante,</hi> none replying till <hi>A. S.</hi> was abroad? Is there any need to bring a great printing presse, to squeese to death a poor worme trodden on before? Or to bring many leavers to break an egge, that makes small resistance? The truth is, <hi>A. S.</hi> his Observations are like a man with a Pole-axe, knocking a man on the head, to kill a fly lighting on his beard.</p>
                  <p>For though he sayth, <hi>he humbly submitteth to the Protestant Churches,</hi> yet he lays about him, as if he would knock them all down unto a submission to <hi>A. S.</hi> whosoever they be that will not stoop to his book. For though he thinks that <hi>all Protestant and Christian Churches</hi> are <hi>for him</hi> rather then for the <hi>five Ministers,</hi> as he intimates in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Epistle, and therefore in all likelihood, professeth a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to them; yet he will find many Churches in <hi>London</hi> (he would wonder if we should name how many) that will not submit to his book, and yet come to the publike Ordinance, doe not separate, but are most willing to submit to the truth, regularly discussed, cleared, and brought down to them. Yet still <hi>James Cranford</hi> stands fixed in the Licence page, in black and not blush, for asserting that <hi>A. S.</hi> his Observations, &amp;c. are <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>necessary.</hi> When as they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unlesse <hi>preposterousnesse, abuse of good men,</hi> and the <hi>disturbance of the people,</hi> be <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>necessary.</hi> For though the ensuing answer will prove them evill, yet they will never be proved necessary evills. They are not so much as <hi>civilly necessary,</hi> either <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> as commanded by Parliament, or Assembly, or <hi>necessitate medij,</hi> as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to compose, but indispose the minds of men, to embrace things prejudiced with the violence of private spirits. Men will not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be whipt and compelld by one inferior.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Are the Observations <hi>seasonable,</hi> which doe but <hi>interstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere,</hi> make a noyse, whilst the Divines are disputing, drawing the people together in heaps, there taking up their parts, to defend, one against another, and pre-ingage themselves before they come to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:196665:4"/> heare what the Assembly will say? For such a book cannot come forth, but it makes a thousand dispute in a week, every one then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for his owne, when it is so irregularly and illegally taken from him. Are they for the <hi>vindication of all Protestant Churches,</hi> when as in condemning the Apologie, they condemne <hi>many,</hi> very many Churches in <hi>England, many</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> generally <hi>all</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> notwithstanding some private Letters and Manuscripts sent over, to which we shall answer afterwards. Are they for the <hi>defence of the authoritie of Parliament,</hi> in opposition to the Apologie? doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie touch one hayre of the honourable heads of the Parliament?

                     <hi>they allow more to the Civill Magistrate, then they think others principles can?</hi> Doth not <hi>A.

                  <p>I will not by Gods help wrong the <hi>A. S.</hi> in an hayre of thy head, therefore I relate not all you say, but let me say what I think, which to say will do you no harme.

And so you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime a <hi>defence</hi> of that which yet hath no <hi>existence.</hi> The question is not resolved.

Let us measure your respect to them, whilest the advantage of the higher ground whereon it stands be removed. Away with your <hi>dare verba,</hi> your froathy words; This is the truth, so much you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect them, as <hi>A. S.</hi> respects them.

                  <p>Now let the Protestant Churches (to whom you say you submit) judge whether in these words, there be not a notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. For wherein do the five Ministers and their Churches differ from many Churches in <hi>England,</hi> diverse in <hi>Holland,</hi> and generally all within the Patent of <hi>New-England,</hi> if you account these places Protestant?</p>
                  <p>It may be you will object, Mr. <hi>Parkers Letter and some Manuseripts from New-England, and the Letter from Zealand.</hi> To Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we need say little, the Letter will answer for us, though Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> little thought when he wrote it, to find an <hi>A. S.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or that his brother <hi>Bayly</hi> would have printed his Letter seemingly to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the disputation of the Assembly, as if he meant to beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, though but with shews and shadows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> sayth not one word for a <hi>Classicall Presbyterie,</hi> (the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:196665:5"/> main difference in hand) but for a <hi>Congregationall,</hi> that he would have in some things more managed by the Presbyters of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, without putting every thing to the vote of the people of the Congregation, because some <hi>confusion</hi> hath followed upon it. Doth in necessaries abuse take away the use? There was confusion in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> Or is there any mention of this in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, that all businesses of the Church must be put to the vote of the Congregation?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That in that thing onely there hath been an arguing on both fides. Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noyse</hi> only are mentioned in the letter, to be on the one side, and all the other Churches on the other, against Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noyse.</hi> And thirdly, Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> doth not say he won the day, but as he answered their Arguments (as he saith) so he confesseth they answered his Arguments, and the thing is left to consideration. Yea a godly man of New-England told me that the Churches of New-England did conceive that Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved full satisfaction from them in that point. How ever it were all amounts but to a private letter subscribed by one man, yet <hi>Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur</hi> saith <hi>I. C.</hi> as if much to the purpose. But look but a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to our answer to a Letter from Zealand, and you shall find the judgement of New-England in letters newly come over.</p>
                  <p>To any private copies or Manuscripts from New-England: one Mr. <hi>Rutherfoard</hi> hath answered, as too much jumping with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie and opposite to <hi>Classicall Presbyterie.</hi> Another, if it had come forth, would have been keener against <hi>A. S.</hi> then the Apologie is. So that if the Apologie do differ from that, its onely because the Apologie more agrees with the reformed Churches of this Island. And for the third, it hath nothing at all for a <hi>Classicall Presbyterie,</hi> but some things touching the ordering of Congregationall Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, and all these are but private intelligencers, and mutuall advicers, not determinations or Nationall. No more then, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, Mr. <hi>Cranford</hi> or <hi>A. S.</hi> will account the strange <hi>Queries</hi> on the Apologie and Scotch Commissioners Reply to be the sence of New-England, though but of one man of that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>As for the Letter of <hi>Zealand,</hi> I cannot tell how to speake all the truth, and not offend some, whom by my will I would not in the least displease. Sure this will not offend to tell <hi>A. S.</hi> that in <hi>Holland,</hi> if not in <hi>Zealand,</hi> are some Churches that are fully with the five Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, unto which some of them do relate. And to speak these things

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:196665:7"/> to the Letter it selfe, being matters of fact, I hope cannot justly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. 1. That that Letter came admirably punctuall upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nick after the first reply to the Apol. was out. 2. That a Scottish Knight nine or ten dayes before it was known abroad, that it was to come, said, <hi>What if yee receive a Letter from Zealand, disliking the Apologie?</hi> or to that effect. 3. That there is a Scottish Church (of which one Spang is a very busie agent) at <hi>Trevere,</hi> hard by <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> whence the Letter came. 4. That there are in it many high passages, seeming so prejudiciall to our worghy Magistracy, that it justifies that of the Apologie, saying, <hi>That the five Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, &amp;c. give more to the Civill Magistrates, then the principles of some Presbyterians do.</hi> The said Letter giving so <hi>too little</hi> to the Magistracy, that the State of <hi>England,</hi> I thinke, cannot approve it here among us. <hi>Verbum sapienti sat est.</hi> More may be thought, upon evident grounds, but not spoken here. 5. Most happily by almost a miraculary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in this nick of time came two Letters from <hi>New-England</hi> to countermand Mr. <hi>Parkers</hi> Letter thence, and the other from <hi>Zealand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first from Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> Governor of <hi>New-England, To his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and very good Brother, Mr.</hi> Hugh Peters <hi>Minister of the Gospel, these deliver in London. Our late Assembly of about fourtie Elders met, wherein the way of our Churches was approved, and the Presbytery disallowed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Winthrop, Governor. Decemb.</hi> 10th. 1643.</p>
                  <p>The second from another of <hi>New-England,</hi> to another Minister in <hi>Old-England,</hi> about the same time, wherein we have these passages. <hi>We have had,</hi> sayth he, <hi>a Synod lately in our Colledge, wherein sundry things were agreed on gravely, as, That the votes of the people are needfull in all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions and excommunications, at least in way of consent; all yeelding to act with their consent.</hi> 2. <hi>That those that are fit matter for a Church, though they are not alwayes able to make large and particular relations of the worke and doctrine of faith, yet must not live in the commission of any known sin, or the neglect of any known dutie.</hi> 3. <hi>That consociation of Churches in way of more generall meetings yeerly, and more private monethly or quarterly, as Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Synods are very comfortable and necessary for the peace and good of the Churches.</hi> 4. <hi>It was generally desired that the exercitium of the Churches power, might onely be in the Eldership in each particular Church, unlesse their times be apparent in their worke.</hi> 5. <hi>That parishes Churches in Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land could not be right without a renewed Covenant at least, and the refusers excluded. And were not New-England so farre, the Churches of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:196665:7"/>
                     <hi>would soon send a third, punctually to approve the Apologie, unlesse it be for their neerer complyance with them who notwithstanding have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have been the longer in answer to this clause, because we find <hi>A. S.</hi> to be but the Text of other mens Commentary discourses; who say, That <hi>the five Ministers will oppose all the visible Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world.</hi> If they did, it were not such a wonder, as for one <hi>Wickliff</hi> in one age, one <hi>Husse</hi> in another, and <hi>Luther</hi> in a third to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all the world.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, all Churches generally, partly by tyrannie, and partly by securitie, are grown so corrupt, that to apologize for a through Reformation seems to reprove all, and so all are readie to be offended, that are lesse reformed. We have heard of sad stories of late but true, (not teld in a corner) of the <hi>lamentable over-spreading of Popery, Atheisme, drunkennesse in some Kingdoms, and adulterie, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, &amp;c. in others.</hi> If we reform but in part, by halves, imitating <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. towards the Pope, <hi>cutting off the head of Prelacie, and sitting down in their chair, (similia non sunt contraria)</hi> as Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> meeting with a Classicall Presbyterie in his way to New-England, said they were but thirteen Bishops, for one) the cry of the sin against our light and opportunitie will call back our reeling Reformation (like will hasten to like) an unblest posture will leave us unhealed of our sins; and our sins will make us become any thing. Had not the Abbeys been pulled down, the <hi>Priories</hi> since had had opportunitie to have risen. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> grinds the Idol to powder, that it might be quite abolished. I speak all this by way of supposition, what shall upon full debate be found to be the <hi>idol,</hi> the <hi>nest</hi> of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the <hi>chaire</hi> of Prelacie, the <hi>half-reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus of your charging the five Ministers with dissenting from all <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches. The expression that follows is a most grosse one. That they differ from all <hi>Christian</hi> Churches. I say grosse in two things. 1 To call <hi>them Churches,</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> that are not Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant (and <hi>ergo</hi> are Popish) now since the Councell of Trent, wherein they gave Christ a bill of divorce (as the learned assert) anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing most of his maine truths. The popish (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Saints in secret here and there) are in a dependence on Antichrist. 2 To charge it as a crime on the five Ministers to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them, when as it is a sin and shame not to dissent from them. If you dissent not from them, you will never kindly dissent from the entitled Mo. <hi>R. A. BB.</hi> and Rt. Rev. BB. I observe that men
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:196665:8"/> in their Replies secretly afore they are aware run to the popish marks of a Church, <hi>viz. visibilitie, succession, universalitie.</hi>

I am distressed how to put home to this, and yet prudently. I tell thee, <hi>A. S.</hi> Thy <hi>accusation</hi> is a grosse falshood. For their respect to the Parliament, and their respect from the Parliament, let many of the choice mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houses speake, they will soon prove thee a grosse—.

None but he that hath <hi>A. S.</hi> as part of his name, would say so. For all discreet men see plainly, that as the <hi>forme</hi> and stile of the Apologie is most sweet, so the <hi>matter</hi> now in hand so much as is there intimated, is the question. Can that be an offence to the Parliament, for the five Ministers to propound that of the things they are to debate (by Ordinance of Parliament) which is to them the question, making it ready, and leaving it for debate in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly? Yea, whether the whole draught of the Apologie be to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:196665:10"/> condemned or commended by the Parliament, that is also a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yet unresolved, by Parliament, Assembly, and a considerable part of Citie and Kingdome. Therefore why doth one <hi>A. S.</hi> presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously make it a crime against the Parliament? Since the thrice wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <note place="margin">
                        <hi>March</hi> 13. 1643.</note> Parliament had it in debate in the house, being put on by the Letters from <hi>Middleborough</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and upon the speech of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mr. <hi>Seldon,</hi> and others, they resolved with a generall acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Apologie was to be left as it was found, <hi>unblamed.</hi> The God of heaven in much mercy blesse the Parliament, as for all the good they have done, so for their uprightnesse therein. The joy of the Churches is now as high as their sorrows would have been deep, had it been condemned. For it would to them have been not onely a dolefull ante, or anti, but-anticipating-presage. But blessed be our Parliament-guiding God; that as they had no hand in the Apologie, so they would have no hand against it. Therefore away <hi>A. S.

                  <p>Ile tell you what one said to this. <hi>Would God he had rather no patient, then he should have no patience, then the Church should be his patient, (seeing he hath no more skill in her grief; that he had no clyent, then that he should be a treacherous Advocate; that he would rather do nothing then evill. For it is a sad thing, said he, that good men neer their end should write some sorrie peece, to be a momement of their declining in their last dayes, and of their disgrace before they are buried.</hi> As a worthy man a little afore his death wrote in defence of Ceremonies, for which formerly he had suffered. A warning to <hi>A.

                  <speaker>A. S.</speaker>
                  <p>His first Consideration. Whether in any Ecclesiasticall or Politick Assembly of the Christian world wherein things are carried by pluralitie of voices, it be ordinarie for any inconsiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:196665:12"/> thereof, to joyn in a particular combination among themselves, and therein to take particular resolutions?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M. S.</speaker>
                  <p>We have heard of some Parliaments in Europe, that the House of Peers is so constitute <hi>that if a vote passe where somes consciences amongst them cannot yeeld to, they may modestly enter in the House their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from it.</hi> But whether this be so or not, the five Ministers did not take particular resolutions and publish them in print, to crosse the proceedings and disputes of the Assembly; or state a question yet unresolved by the Assembly, but onely told the Kingdome <hi>de facto,</hi> what they had held and practised, and therefore in the Apologie speake in the <hi>past time,</hi> with some very few and short touches upon what ground.</p>
                  <p>Wherein they declare themselves to close nearer with the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, were they all Presbyterian (as we know the contrary) then thousands ever thought they would.</p>
                  <p>And withall they do professe themselves so unwedded to their <note place="margin">See Apol. p. 10. It is their second golden rule, by which they walked.</note> former practises, and so far from over-weening their present judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that upon discovery of more light, they are most willing to open their eyes upon it, and let it in. And therefore you <hi>A. S.</hi> have done very ill, to discourage them as much as in you is, from that sweetnesse of Spirit, that hath appeared in all their writings and carriages.</p>
                  <p>But our main answer to this your Consideration (which makes it a grosse inconsideration, if not untruth) is this, That the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is not to conclude things by a pluralitie of votes, if you dare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Ordinance of Parliament, whose words are <hi>to conferre and treate touching Doctrine, Discipline, &amp;c. and to deliver their opinions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, as shall be most agreeable to the word of God.</hi> And <hi>in case of difference</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ordin. for the calling of the Assembly, pag. 4. 5.</note>
                     <hi>of Opinion among the said Divines, they shall present the same, together with their Reasons thereof, to the Houses of Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words, besides confutation of your <hi>pluralitie of voyces,</hi> doe more then allow so much as is done in the Apologeticall Narration, That being but a Narration of <hi>past things.</hi>

                  <p>His second Consideration, <hi>Whether in taking such resolutions, they should not consequently resolve themselves to quit the Assembly, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as Parties?</hi>

                  <p>The Antecedent was denied before on the first Consid. therefore the consequence is destroyed. And for the <hi>Consequent</hi> or Proposition it selfe, of the five Ministers quitting the Assembly, and to appeare as parties, for setting forth the Apologie; I utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:196665:13"/> your motion, as striking at the worthy Commissioners of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as if they likewise should quitt the Assembly for replying to the Apologie. Men of a farre better spirit then you are. And though they be somewhat ingaged in a Settled Presbytery, yet carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more sagely and moderately, then many of our owne men. An honour for them, and a shame for us.</p>

                     <hi>His fourth Consideration (and for the third vanisheth upon our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to first and second) whether this Apologeticall Narration was necessary, when yee found the calumnies, mis-takes, mis-apprehensions of your opinions, and mists, that had gathered about you, or were rather cast upon your persons in your absence, begin by your presence againe, and the blessing of God upon you, to scatter and vanish, without speaking a word for your selves and cause?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M. S.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea it was. For looke but to the next full period afore; and you shall find that this you repeate as touching that scattering and vanishing of mists, doth but relate to the people, and onely to some of them, <hi>viz. Those that professe or pretend the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</hi> These mens serene spirits onely, were the beames that began to scatter the mysts. And therefore the Apologists speake distinctly and punctually (and not indefinitely as you) in the words you seeme to quote; <hi>viz.</hi> they say that they found <hi>many</hi> (mark) <hi>many</hi> of those mists not <hi>all;</hi> And did but <hi>begin</hi> to scatter, as you your selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate. The Apologists say, they did but <hi>begin</hi> to scatter. For in the apprehension of the Apologists, their motion was like the lowrings of an inconstant morning, the mists ascend, and anon descend, and by and by ascend, and turne into a <hi>Scottish-</hi>mist, as the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>That will wett an Englisle-man to the skinne.</hi> The <hi>mist went up by the hills; but</hi> (as the other Proverb is) <hi>down by the Mills,</hi> they turned into raine. What mean else those words of the Apologie; <hi>Our eares</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apo. pag. 1.</note>
                     <hi>have been so filled with a suddain and unexpected noyse of confused exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the interpretation of most reflecting on us, that awakened thereby, wee are enforced to anticipate a little that discovery of our selves, which wee otherwise resolved to have left to time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And those words of the Apologie: <hi>Whereas our silence upon all the fore-mentioned grounds, hath been by the ill interpretation of some, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apol. p. 27.</note>
                     <hi>either to our consciousnesse of the badnesse and weaknesse of our cause, or to our inabilitie to maintaine what wee assert in difference from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And those words of the Apologie; <hi>Since the change of times from</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apo. p. 31.</note>
                     <hi>our exile, wee have indured that which to our spirits is no lesse grievous; the opposition and reproach of good men, even to the threatning of another banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:196665:13"/> No doubt but the Apologisers know what they say, and what they can say, if called to speake out. Besides, if the people had let them alone, should seeme some Ministers would not. O, it was an unhappie Anticipation (O, if the will of God had been to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it) that in the very nick, before the Assembly met, that two Books should forestall the Market, the one penned by a learned <hi>Scot,</hi> and the other by a learned <hi>English-man,</hi> that set the tongues of men so a wame.</p>
                  <p>First to vomit out upon the five Ministers Tenet, and next to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse their persons, before the Assembly had made one Syllogisme, <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae.</hi> Hence the Apologie (poore meeke thing) was forced to speake; and thereupon <hi>A. S.</hi> so fiercely breathed (I had almost said brayed) out against it so many bitter words.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>A. S.</speaker>
                  <p>Tells us in this his 4. Consideration, <hi>of the honour the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shewed the Apologists, in calling them to be members of the Assembly</hi> which was enough to justifie their persons from all aspersions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Apologie.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M. S.</speaker>
                  <p>To this we answer; That they and their friends will ever acknowledge the Honorable Parliaments great respect to them. And so much the more, in these times wherein great <hi>A. S.</hi> and little &amp;c. do so labour to render them odious. But I think I should not crosse the sence of the Parliament if I should not make it an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall <hi>major</hi> proposition: That all whom the Honorable Parliament shall call to be members of the Assembly, are <hi>ipso facto</hi> vindicated, from all aspertions; and so to conclude, that all Episcopall prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men that in life and practise have been—if they should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be of the Assembly, were <hi>eo nomine</hi> vindicated from all asperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I am sure <hi>de facto</hi> that some very learned men were called by the sweet indulgence of the Honorable Parliament for the common good to be Members of the grave Assembly, who since upon better knowledge of them, are by the Parliament purged out of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (a good ridd, the Assembly is the better for their absence) and some are at Oxford, see how <hi>terse</hi> they be; and some in prison, see how their membership of the Assembly have vindicated them. Be sure of it, that the choice of men for the Assembly was to find men good, not to make them so. And two worthy Parliament men of a Countie may not know at first all the faults in every Town, or the lint on every black coat. And therefore since that, the worthy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hath well brusht some.</p>
                  <p>If the Parliament puts ever so much honour upon the five Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:196665:14"/> in calling them to the Assembly; yet since many have aspersed them, or some how laboured to make them odious to Kingdoms and Nations, and who but the order of <hi>A. S.</hi> mainly instigating. And therefore this fully answers to your last <hi>Quaere</hi> in your fourth Consideration. Whether this Apologie was necessarie after the first cloud was nere over? every night must be cleared by a new rise of the Sun.</p>

                  <p>His fifth Consideration, sayth, that <hi>the five Ministers doe blame</hi> all <hi>Protestant Churches, as not having the power of godlinesse, and the profession thereof, with difference from carnall and formall Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, advanced and held forth among them as among</hi> you, <hi>which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought to be particularly intended against the</hi> Scots.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M. S.</speaker>
                  <p>Sure it is no otherwise commonly thought to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intended against the Scots; and generally to blame all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches, then in or by your common sence deriving <hi>species,</hi> vain seemings to your phantasie, from your outward sences an evill eye ill affected. For the Apologie cals our dear brethren the Scots, the more reformed Churches. And for the words <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>among you,</hi> whereby you would present them setting themselves as an opposite member of distinction to all Protestant Churches, and blaming them all as undistinguished from carnall, and formall Christians, in comparison of them and their five Churches; the words <hi>all</hi> and <hi>you</hi> are forged and foysted in by your self, and so must go for very falshoods charged upon them. The words of the Apologie are. 1. <hi>That they and many others had but observed touching the non advance of the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apo. pag. 4.</note>
                     <hi>power of godlinesse, &amp;c.</hi> among some, <hi>what themselves had generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</hi> The five Ministers do not charge it, but repeat it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by themselves. 2 It is not said it was confessed, and they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served there was <hi>no</hi> power of godlinesse, but it was not <hi>advanced.</hi> 3 Nor is it said it was <hi>not advanced,</hi> but not advanced <hi>as in this our Island.</hi> This <hi>Island</hi> being a common phrase, yea and your phrase too in the title of your booke, to signifie <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> both.</p>
                  <p>And then where is that particular intendment against Scotland; or the five Ministers laying their Churches in the ballance against other Churches?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, they speak but <hi>indefinitely</hi> in a contingent matter, and therefore can be construed but of some particulars; and therefore did not ayme at <hi>all.</hi> You know how highly they esteeme of New-England, and therefore that is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cluded from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:196665:14"/> of the power of godlinesse, as in this Island of great Britaine English and Scots are included. However, as no man that is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man either by hearsay or travell over the next Sea, will accuse Scotland as most carnall and formall (it were well for the world if in that, &amp;c. others had not farre exceeded them) so none of us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Pharisees, will excuse our Nations of remisnesse in advancing the power of godlinesse in apparent view above carnalitie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie.</p>
                  <p>You see by our answer to the Apologie, that not that Apologie but your <hi>will</hi> caused you to speak that which is not by wise men once to be mentioned at this time, as if the Apologists intended to say any the least thing to grieve our brethren the Scots.</p>

S.</hi> doth not like the conversion; we answer positively.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Its no arrogating for any Christian upon just occasion to make his confession of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The confession of faith in doctrine that is in all the best refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches is theirs; For one touching pure Discipline, it was not found in Scotland whiles the tyrannie of the Bishops prevailed. Whiles things are in <hi>fieri,</hi> a wise man will not expect them <hi>in facto esse.</hi> Faith may be when confession dares not appear. <hi>A. S.</hi> is angrie with that confession of faith in the Apologie; and hath opened the mouthes of many others (as we hear) ready to bark too at it, they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:196665:15"/> do but stay their turnes, why then doth he call for more confession?</p>

                  <p>Mark how this fellow <hi>A.</hi> S. 1 supposeth it arrogancie in the Parliament to have any directive power in matters of Religion, in case the Assembly (which God forbid) should mistake. Surely by this bold expression he would not have the Parliament judge of the reasons of the Assembly in case of dissent. Least of all doth <hi>A. S.</hi> consider that the Parliament are Members of many excellent Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; That they laid down the Common Prayer book in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses before some Presbyterians could see reason, to do so. That the Parliament so looked on the Assembly chosen by them, as not to take things meerly upon trust, but see with their own eyes.</p>
               </sp>
               <p n="2">2 He dreamingly supposeth that either our Assembly is like the Assembly of Scotland for breadth and strength; or else he takes them for <hi>a Church,</hi> and in the act of prophesying; which last I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>A. S.</hi> being a rank Presbyterian should in the least allow of, and call the five Ministers to the rule thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>A. S.</hi> supposeth that it is lesse convenient to the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse for the wronged five Ministers to appeal to the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>A.

S.</hi> his fine intimation prompted to all scandalous and false teaching erronious Ministers, to take up and learn, in their cases relating to Religion, to wave the Parliament, and to go to the Assembly.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>A. S.</hi> supposeth that the Assembly would be so unwise (see what a silly fellow <hi>A. S.</hi> is) as to go beyond their Ordinance, to judge one another.

               </head>
               <p>HAving diligently perused the <hi>cacologeticall</hi> or rough commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of <hi>A. S.</hi> upon the smooth <hi>Apologeticall</hi> Narration of the five Ministers, I find the greatest difficultie, that he is like to encounter, who by a sober Answer shall desire to make the world amends for that injurie, which that writing hath done it, is this, how to make his Answer soft enough. For the truth is, that here is much more Anger or passion, then reason, to turn away, and the wise man informs us, that it is <hi>A soft Answer, that turneth away wrath.</hi> Prov. 15. 1. If <hi>A. S.</hi> could be but redeemed out of the hand of that great jealousie, wherewith he burns over his present apprehensions <hi>in re presbyterali,</hi> though all the arguments, and strength of discourse, wherewith his judgement is supported therein, were left entire to him, he would be found in a sufficient posture himself, to do himself the right of giving satisfaction unto the world, for the wrong he hath done it, in that discourse, and to make his attonement with his own pen. Though in many cases Anger is able to do more, then reason can undo; yet in matter of argument or writing, the little finger of a mans reason, is commonly able to pull down what the loins of his passion, hath in a tumultuarie way and method built up. Any man that shall but diligently observe the endlesse varietie and multitude of keene expostulations, imperious interrogations, the importune, peremptory, and insulting charges, criminations, and aspersions, the wrigglings, wringings, wrestings, wranglings, the streinings, stretchings, stingings, struglings, the captious, crooked, and crosse-grain'd Interpretations of things, wherewith that peice is farced in an unreasonable proportion to the bulk of it, cannot lightly but conclude, that Indignation was the chief Oracle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with, about the framing of it.</p>
               <p>But because I would willingly decline all occasions of heat and recrimination, as far as a sober and just vindication, not so much of the persons, as of the cause so evill-intreated therein, will bear, I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:196665:17"/> shall chiefly confer with <hi>A. S.</hi> about his Reals, and leave men of common civilitie to determine and judge of his personals; unlesse (possibly) somewhat in this kind shall now and then, occasionally fall in. I make no question but that the Apologists, will be well able to bear it, that the cause which they maintain, should have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of their persons, in point of defence; nor are they so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the consciousnesse of their own worth and innocence, but that they are very well able to be out, and bear the want of so much of their reputations for a time, as the Observations and Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of I know not who have unjustly taken from them; especially in case they shall see it bestowed by their Friends upon the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of that honorable cause wherein they are engaged and declared.</p>

Surely <hi>A.

The Civill Magistrate is much beholding to the Presbyter, for giving of him a consecrated sword to fight the Presbyterian battels; and for perswading him to pull out his own eyes, upon this presumption, that he shall see better with his. I perceive Presbyterie is policie in the highest; and seeks to put the Magistrate between it self, and the envie and discontent of the people; and yet neverthelesse hopes to gain from the hand of the Magistrate such an interpretation of this practise, as thereby to be esteemed the best and faithfullest friend it hath, in all the world. This cunning of the spirit we now speak of, puts me in mind of the Ape, that took the spaniels foot to pull the chest-nut out of the fire. Surely the frame and constitution of Presbyterie, is exactly calculated for the meridian of this present world; but whither it will indifferently serve for that which is to come, <hi>totus dubito,</hi> I am in doubt all over.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:196665:24"/> to tell him what, and where it is; and yet they doe but <hi>peep and mutter</hi> in their answer, and make no man the wiser by it.

But if the one and the other be cloz'd up in such an ammunition of rocks of distinctions, as <hi>A.

The very darknesse it selfe of the distinctions which he is necessitated to use, to make his way to come at the one and at the other, is a light sufficient to discover, that neither the one nor the other is any where to be found within the territories either of reason or of truth. But let us see the Distinctions play a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, for their Masters credit.</p>
               <p>For the first: The <hi>Magistrates power</hi> (saith he) <hi>viz. in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (for so he must necessarily be understood, by the Antithesis in the former clause or member of this Distinction, where he denies <hi>a Directive power</hi> unto him, <hi>in matters of Religion) is not in, or intrinsecall to the Church, but extrinsecall and about the Church.</hi> Is it <hi>in,</hi> i. <hi>intrinsecall</hi> to matters of Religion; and but <hi>extrinsecall</hi> in respect of the Church? So then (it seems) <hi>A. S.</hi> his Presbyteriall Church, is somewhat more inward, intimate, and intrinsecall, then the Religion of this Church; otherwise, how should the <hi>power of the Magistrate</hi> penetrate <hi>into</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> thereof, and yet not reach <hi>into,</hi> but onely <hi>unto</hi> the Church it selfe? By this distinction he hath utterly disgrac'd his Presbyteriall Government, by making the Churches under it, more internall and inward, then the Religion that is to be found in them. If the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists had but whispered one tittle of such a saying, though at never such a distance, it had been enough to have produced seven reasons more (at least) against their Toleration, then are yet levied or brought forth into the world.</p>

For hath not the Presse very lately been delivered of this peice of Presbyterie, that <hi>the classicall Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>

For if a Classis shall cite or excommunicate a member of a Church, against the judgement and consent of the Elders of that Church, let all the world judge, whether that be not an act of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall power without the Church.</p>
               <p>If it be replied, no; because that Church did implicitly consent in yeelding their Elders for members of that Presbyterie; We reply, that if either your publick Law constreins that Church upon penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">

And so the Classis, according to <hi>A. S.</hi> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, is like a Magistrate, which is <hi>a Bishop without, and about that Church.</hi>

               <p>His second Distinction, is of the subject of this power, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; whom he makes two-fold, <hi>truly Christian, and not truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi> But</p>

If he saith that by <hi>a Magistrate tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christian,</hi> he understands an <hi>orthodox</hi> Magistrate; <hi>what if he had one</hi>

                  <hi>or two errours, would be yet permit him to be orthodox,</hi> and truly Christian, <hi>or not?</hi> Till <hi>A. S.</hi> here specifies, <hi>Sermones generales non movent</hi> (his own rule) For my self, untill I shall be otherwise informed by himself, I shall make use of my reason to beleeve, that by <hi>a Magistrate truly Christian, A. S.</hi> onely means a Magistrate, who in his judgement is Presbyteriall: and that this qualification of Presbyterialisme, and <hi>truth of Christianitie</hi> in a Magistrate, are against all contradictions and counter-poyseings whatsoever, <hi>termini aequipollentes</hi> in his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique. And if this be his meaning, the King (to be sure) hath none of his <hi>power</hi> as yet, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> and <hi>jure in re;</hi> nor hath the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (at least for ought <hi>A. S.</hi> or the Kingdom knoweth) any whit more of it, then the King. And whatsoever it hath done hitherto, by any <hi>executive, coercive, externall</hi> power <hi>about</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> or Church affairs (in which kind it hath done very much) depends as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the validitie and justifiablenesse of it, upon this supposition, that it Presbyterializeth. Whence it followeth, that he that cannot, or doth not beleeve that the Parliament is of a Classique inclination, cannot (with the leave of <hi>A. S.</hi> his distinction) judge them to have done lawfully or warrantably any thing that they have done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, about, or for the Church.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that till <hi>A. S.</hi> will please to define, what manner of Magistrate he must be, that shall passe the test of his distinction, for <hi>truly Christian,</hi> we are constrained to suspend our bountie in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>executive, coercive, externall power about the Church,</hi> upon any man.

There are two reasons very considerable why the Kings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah might be invested by God with a larger power in matters of Religion, then Kings or Magistrates under the Gospel have any ground or warrant to claime from them. First, they were types of Christ, which no King under heaven at this day is; Secondly, not the people onely, but the very Land over which they ruled, were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall also; the one, of the spirituall Church of Christ, the other of the heavenly inheritance of that Church: both of them holy and consecrate in speciall manner unto God. If Kings and Magistrates under the Gospel can plead either these reasons, or any other of equall consideration with these, I shall not scruple an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:196665:27"/> of an equalitie of power in them. But otherwise, to alledge the power of the Kings of Judah in matters of Religion, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture of Kings and Magistrates under the Gospel, with the like, justifies the arguing of the Prelaticall School, which pleads the order of the Aaronicall Priesthood, to demonstrate the necessitie of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropoliticall sovereigntie.</p>

It no where appears that any of the godly Kings of Judah, ever had, or exercised any power to suppresse, banish, imprison, trample upon, crush, or grinde the faces of any godly persons among them, were they few or many, onely because they were for a while tender in point of conscience to concurre with the major part of the Priests, Scribes or Levites in some things disputeable between them, and others in the Land. Untill <hi>A.

S.</hi> (or any other) will needs make the Kings of Judah tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries to his opinion, concerning that <hi>coercive power</hi> we speak of in the Civill Magistrate, he must first prove, that these Kings were invested with that power which they exercised in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by a morall Law, and which is of perpetuall obligation and engagement upon other Nations. For such a weak man as I, will rather incline to think, that it was conferr'd upon them by a Law Politique and judiciall: and which no more concerneth or obligeth Kings and Magistrates of other Nations, then that Law mentioned in the same place with it, (and which indeed is part of it) <hi>(Deut.</hi> 13.) which injoyneth <hi>ihe slaying of the inhabitants of the</hi> idolatrous <hi>City with the edge of the sword, and the destroying of it utterly with all that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the cattell thereof, with the edge of the sword; and the gathering of all the spoyl thereof into the midst of the street thereof, and the burning of the City with fire, and all the spoil thereof every whit; and the making it an heap for ever, and the not building it again.</hi> I think <hi>A. S.</hi> himself doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christian Kings or Magistrates engag'd in conscience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all the particulars of this Law.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>25</label> 8. (and lastly) if you consult with those passages in the Law, where that power, which the Kings of Judah exercised about Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Idolaters (for they went no further; they medled not with the crushing of Sects or Schismes as we heard) you will find, that it was the generalitie or entire body of the Church or Nation of the Jews, and not their Kings, that was invested with it by God.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:196665:27"/> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. from the beginning to the end: and again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 5. and Chap. 12. 2, 3. with many of like consideration. So that what they did in this kind, they did it, or were to have done it, in the Name, and with the consent of the body of their people.</p>
               <p>But the Grand Pillar and supporter of this <hi>Coercive power</hi> in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, is this angry and discontented argument. What? would you have all Religions, sects, and schismes tolerated in Christian Churches?

But, first, orthodox and able Ministers ought in the course of their publique ministery, and otherwise upon occasion, in a grave, sober, and inoffensive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, soundly from the Scriptures to evince the folly, vanitie and falshood of all such wayes. Secondly, others also that have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of light and knowledge from God, are bound to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute occasionally the best of their indeavours towards the same end. Thirdly, in case the Minister shall be negligent or forgetfull of his dutie in this kind, the Magistrate may and ought from time to time to admonish him, that he fulfill his ministery in that point also.

Fiftly, (and lastly) If it be an whole Church that is so corrupted and infected, the rest of the neighbour Churches (in case it hath any) ought to admonish it, and to indeavour the reclaiming of it. if it be refractory after competent admonition, and means used for the reducing of it, they may and ought to renounce communion with it: and so set a mark or brand of heresie and obstinacie in the forehead of it.

               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label> First, because God hath anointed and sanctified his Word, and the ministery hereof, for the <hi>casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts it self against the knowledge of God, and for the bringing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivitie every thought unto the obedience of Christ.</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. The Apostle in this place, <hi>v.</hi> 4. affirms, that the <hi>weapons of his warfare</hi> (meaning the knowledge which he had of God, and of Jesus Christ in the Gospel, and his abilities of utterance and preaching) <hi>were mighty through God,</hi> for those ends and purposes. When God hath appointed a means, and that of so much efficacie and power, either to prevent an inconvenience, or to accomplish any end or effect whatsoever, for men to wave this means, and to interesse another of their own, is both to put an affront upon God, and to consult frustration and disappointment to themselves. And for mine own part, I am all thoughts made, that the true and adaequate reason why those Sects, and Schismes and wild opinions, which are lately started amongst us, gather so much strength and head, and grow so fast upon us as they do daily, is this; that we reject the wisedome and counsell of God for the opposing and suppressing of them, and have recourse to our own arm, hoping by disgracing, displacing, way-laying, impoverishing, suspending, imprisoning, and other weapons and wayes of the flesh, to ease our selves of the burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse and trouble of them. Besides the Scripture mentioned, there is a passage of full importance this way, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. 12. &amp;c. <hi>And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministery, for the edifying of the body of Christ, untill we all come into the unitie of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. We see here that Gods designe and desire, as well as ours, is <hi>unitie,</hi> and perfect agreement amongst the Saints, in all matters of faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But how, or by what means, or by whom hath he projected and purposed the obtaining of this his desire? mark, he doth not say, that he gave some Kings, and some Princes, and some Judges, and Justices of the peace, some Pursevants, and some Jaylors, &amp;c. to bring us <hi>into the unitie</hi> of the faith; no, but <hi>he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers,</hi> to bring this desireable end of his to passe. And if we would make more use of these agents and instruments of God, <hi>of the Apostles, Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:196665:28"/>
                  <hi>of Pastors and Teachers,</hi> and lesse of those other (which are our own) for the quenching of those flames of divisions and dissentions that are amongst us in matters of Religion, we might in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood see our desires in this behalf many yeers sooner then by any other course we are like to do. The word of God, especially in the hand of an able Minister (among other ends) is given by God on purpose for the <hi>conviction</hi> and <hi>stopping of the mouthes of gainsayers.</hi> Tit. 1. 9. 11. And therefore this will do it, when a thousand other means, not having this anointing oyl upon them, though never so plausible, and promising in the eye of humane wisedom, will rather open them yet wider, then otherwise.</p>

Externall compulsion in matters of Religion, is of a proper and direct tendencie, to make men twofold more the children of sin (and so of wrath) then they were before, or would be otherwise. Now that which directly tends to increase sin &amp; iniquitie in a Land, cannot be lawfull or from God. Suppose the State-Religion, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:196665:29"/> manner of worshipping God, which the Magistrate practiseth, and professeth, be agreeable to the truth; yet if I, having no such faith of either, but judging in my soule and conscience that both State and Magistrate, are polluted in both, should make profession of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the truth, I should be a notorious hypocrite and dissembler before God and men, wounding my conscience and condemning my selfe, in what I allow in this case. And yet such a profession as this, is that which the compulsive power of the Magistrate seeks to extort from me. In which case I must suffer, because I will not sin, to the ruine and destruction of my soule.</p>
               <p>If it be objected; that the intent of the Magistrates compulsion in this case, is not to extort a profession from me against my judgement and conscience, but to engage me to rectifie and reforme my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the truth, and so to make profession accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>I answer; First, that I stand already engaged by a farre greater band hereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> my peace with God, and the safety of my soule, then suffering temporally from the Civill power. Nor can it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be here replied to me, that many will doe more for feare of a present temporall punishment, then of the future losse of their soules; because they that will doe this, will be ready enough to comply with the Magistrate in his Religion, what ever it be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compulsion. Secondly, If the intent of the temporall compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bent against me, be my engagement to rectifie my judgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth, and then to professe accordingly, why is it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged upon me before it be known, whether I have not discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such my engagements to the uttermost of my power, and yet am not able to call that truth, which the Magistrate would have me so to call? <hi>Many</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) seeke the face of the Ruler:</hi> and who <note place="margin">Pro. 29. 26.</note> would not gladly second the Magistrate in his Religion, if he had his judgement and conscience in his own hand or power?</p>

If the Civill Magistrate hath an actuall coercive power to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse schismes, heresies, &amp;c. because he is <hi>truly Christian,</hi> which he had not before, then truth of Christianitie alters the propertie and tenour of Magistracie, and that for the worse, in respect of those that are in subjection to it, yea, and (possibly) in respect of the best of those that are in such subjection. Before he was <hi>truly Christian,</hi> he had (saith <hi>A.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:196665:29"/> unto him by God, in giving him part and fellowship with the Saints in Jesus Christ, he is invested with a new power to persecute the Saints, and to make them pay dearly for having consciences better (it may be) then his owne, at least better then to comply out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, with what they cannot inwardly digest and approve. If this be the case between a Christian, and the Civill Magistrate under whom he lives, he hath small incouragement, to pray for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of such a Magistrate to the truth, in case he were for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Heterodox or Pagan; it being farre better for him to live under such a Magistracie, which hath no power to mis-use him for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake, then under that which hath, yea, and is made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that it ought to use it accordingly.</p>

That power is very dangerous for a Magistrate to owne, in the exercise whereof, he may very easily (and commonly doth) run an hazard (at least) <hi>of fighting against God,</hi> or of <hi>plucking up</hi> that which God hath <hi>planted,</hi> or of pulling downe that, which God hath built up. But such is that power of suppressing schismes, heresies, &amp;c. which <hi>A. S.

The Assumption I demonstrate by this reason: Because those practises and opinions in Religion, which the Magistrate is borne in hand by those, with whose eyes he sees in such cases, are schismaticall, erroneous, and contrary unto God; may very possibly be the wayes of God, and truths of God (such mens judgements of them notwithstanding.) For first, the judgements of these men are not Apostolicall or infallible. <hi>A. S.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who makes his demands for Presbyterian soveraigntie, as high as another, yet dares not lay claime to this crowne. Therefore it's possible for them to be in a misprision about some Question, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversiall point in Religion. Secondly, Frequent experience shews, that a minor part (yea a partie for number inconsiderable) of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons in a Church or State, may have the mind of God and of Christ amongst them in some particulars, before the generalitie or major part of this Church, comes to be enlightened or interessed in it. For a proofe whereof <hi>ad hominem</hi> we need goe no further, then to that partie of godly persons in the Land, who stood up in Queene <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> his dayes, for Presbyteriall Government, when as the farre greater part both of Magistrates and Ministers in the Kingdome, were in their judgements opposite hereunto, and wholly Episcopall. So that had that Queene, or King, or any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

That power which was never attributed to the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, by any Christians, but onely by those that had very good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that it should be used for them, and on their side, is not like to be a power appertaining to them by divine right, or conferr'd upon them by God. The reason of this proposition is, because it is no wayes credible, that within the compasse of so many ages as are by-gone, no one man of that conscientious generation of Saints, which hath been wont so frequently to deny it self even unto death, should acknowledge such a power in the Civill Magistrate, as did by divine right belong unto him, onely because such an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement was like to make against himself.

That power which in the use of it plainly and palpably tends to the gratification of Satan, carnall and prophane men, is not (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly) derived from God. To prove this proposition, would be but the lighting up of a torch to see the Sun. I assume; But that <hi>power in matters of Religion,</hi> to crush schismes, heresies, &amp;c. which is by <hi>A. S.</hi> and many others pinn'd upon the Magistrates sleeve, is a power of this tendencie and importance in the use of it. <hi>Ergo.</hi> This latter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position shines clear enough with this light. First, a very great part (if not farre the greatest) of those that are like to suffer by it, are men of good conscience, and truly fearing God. This is manifest in the Apologists and men of their judgement, whom <hi>A. S.</hi> himself, over and over (though condemning himself <hi>toties quoties)</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth for very <hi>pious and godly men.</hi> Nor is it like that (ordinarily) men of loose or no conscience, should delight to swim against the streams either of greatnesse or pluralitie, in matters of Religion. Now then it cannot but be conceived to be matter of solemne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to Satan, who is a murtherer, and bloodie enemie to the Saints, to see them disgraced, crushed, troden and trampled upon, especially by those, whom God hath appointed to be their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:196665:31"/> and most of all that this grievous measure should be measured out unto them for the goodnesse of their consciences towards God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the impatient and importune desire of all ignorant, loose, lukewarme, and carnall professors, to have all Religions (as they call them) all wayes, sects, opinions, and practises in Religion, wholly silenc'd, suppress'd, and abolished where they live, excepting onely that one way and practise, which shall be authoriz'd and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the State. Because by this means, they hope they shall not be distracted about their Religion, nor be put upon that sore trouble of seeking it they know not where, or amongst whom; but shall have it put into their mouths by the hand of Authoritie; which they hope likewise will stand between them and harme, in case it should not prove a Religion of that puritie and goodnes, which God requireth.</p>

(And lastly) That power which in the use of it, directly tends to defile and pollute the consciences of men, either by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the softnesse, tendernesse, and ingenuitie of them, or by disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawfull peace and comfort of them, or by both, is a power from beneath, not from above. (This proposition also a conscience any whit ingenuous cannot lightly deny) But such is the <hi>coercive power in matters of Religion,</hi> wherewith <hi>A. S.</hi> would faine befriend himselfe, in the Civill Magistrate. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The truth of the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appears in this consideration: when the conscience of a man hath once broke the bands and tie of it's owne light, and prostituted it selfe to the desires and pleasures of men, against the graine of it's owne judgement and inclination (whereunto it is sorely tempted and urged, when the man is threatned deep, in case he shall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie with the State in their Religion, his judgement and conscience being wholly a verse to it) one of these two great evills or miseries commonly befalls him. Either 1. God takes no more pleasure in such a conscience afterwards, but withdrawing himselfe from it, leaves it unto it selfe, whereupon, secretly (as it were) resenting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of God from it, it falls upon a course of hardening it selfe, and by degrees contracts a boldnesse, impudence, and desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in sinning; as a woman by suffering a breach to be made upon her modestie or chastitie once, often becomes facile and prone to that kinde of sinning afterwards; or else 2. by reflecting upon what it hath done in such a case, and feeding night and day upon the sad thoughts of its owne act, and casting it up between God and it selfe, how grievous a fin it is, to trample upon it's owne light, for any mans sake, or upon any consideration whatsoever, it brings it selfe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:196665:31"/> into grievous agonies of perplexitie, and horrour, out of which it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recovers afterward.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given <hi>A.

For I professe ingenuously, there is nothing seperates between me and his judgement in the point in hand, but onely those ten rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, with their fellows; and if I were able to answer them my selfe, I would abate the condition required to the bargaine, and purchase my agreement with him by mine own labour.</p>

               <p>He knows not which he had best fall upon, but hath a great mind to fasten upon both.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:196665:32"/> agreed for the Government it selfe; yet there are great divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of heart amongst them, concerning the parentage and descent of it. Some out of a desire to have it the more adored and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the world, will needs have it to be of the house and lineage of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptisme, <hi>viz.</hi> from heaven, from the Scriptures; Others of them, fearing that genealogie to be so perplexed and intricate, that it is fitter to make strife and questions of, then demonstration and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, thinke it better to wave that title, and claime, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with a Meropean, in stead of a Phoebean parentage for it; to rise no higher then the libertie or power of the Church it selfe, to seek its originall. Which cleft in the house considered, it was a very prudent spoke put into the wheele of the Apologists, by him that gave counsell (if all tales be true) at no hand to have it put to vote, whether Presbyteriall Government could be prooved from the Scriptures, or no. Such a vote as this might very possibly have prov'd of as interruptory a consequence to the builders of this Government, as the confusion of tongues sometimes did to builders of another fabricke.</p>

As for any power of <hi>Determining matters of Doctrine,</hi> this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of my ken in the <hi>practise of that Church,</hi> then any thing else. I know not well what <hi>A. S.</hi> means, by his phrase of <hi>Determining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine;</hi> but in my notion, and in the Grammaticall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sence of the word, <hi>Determine,</hi> the claime of such a power riseth up as a high partition-wall between me and his Government. If by <hi>a power of Determining matters of Doctrine,</hi> he means nothing else but a libertie, or abilitie of discussing and arguing such matters, and of recommending the issues and results of such discussions, unto the Churches, as consonant (in their judgements) to the truth, with a proposall of their desires unto the Churches, to consider well of them, and to imbrace them, if they can so judge and conceive of them, I have nothing to oppose against this power. But if by his <hi>power to Determine matters of Religion,</hi> he means a power of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or defining, what men shall be bound in conscience to receive and beleeve for truth, and shall be look'd upon as sinning, in case they doe it not, whether they see sufficient ground for what is so concluded, and obtruded upon them, or not (which I partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to be <hi>A. S.</hi> his sence, I am sure is the proper sence of the word) such <hi>a power</hi> is (and I thinke ever will be) the first-borne of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrings of my soule. I confesse I cannot be over-confident that <hi>A. S.</hi> intends the residence of such a power as this, in his Presbyterian Assemblies; partly, because he speakes somewhat like a man in this behalfe elsewhere, supposing it to be <hi>safe even for a few men to dissent from all the world,</hi> in case they have <hi>very strong reasons for their dissent,</hi>

S.</hi> his Government can hold up her head like herselfe, if this iron-mace be taken out of her hand. For my part, if this one Article of a libertie to wave Presbyteriall Injunctions and Decisions, in case of a <hi>non-liquet</hi> from the word of God, to him to whom they are tendred, will be but assented unto, and candidly kept and performed, it would be the best Mediatour I know to reconcile my thoughts and judgement to it.</p>

(And lastly,) In the practise of the Jewish Church, the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Schoole sees a vision or platforme of her Government also. And <hi>A. S.</hi> by your leave, the High-Priest as well in his Authoritie, as in his robes and holy accoutrements, did farre more plausibly, sympathize with Metropoliticall State and Greatnesse, then with Presbyteriall. For my part, I am not able to discerne in all the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Jewish Church, from the one end of it unto the other, any piece, streine, or veine, of such a <hi>patterne</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> speaks of. Surely the vision is so condition'd, as not to be seene but upon Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ground. The man did wisely in granting that he had <hi>no formall or expresse patterne</hi> for his Government, either <hi>from the old,</hi> or <hi>new Testament:</hi> but he should have done more ingenuously to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:196665:35"/>
                  <hi>no nor yet any materiall or implicit patterne neither.</hi> For if he hath any <hi>materiall patterne,</hi> it is so purely <hi>materiall,</hi> that it may contend with <hi>materia prima</hi> it selfe for the prize of invisibilitie. If he hath any <hi>implicit,</hi> it is wrapt up under so many folds and pleights of obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that no seeing eye is able to pierce through to it.</p>
               <p>But doe wee not give sentence too soone? It may be his <hi>patterne from the new Testament</hi> will carry it, though that from the old refus'd to meddle with it. But where shall we seeke this? He tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>That we may see it in the historie of the new Testament, in the judgement gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out at the Synod</hi> (either truly or untruly so called) <hi>of Hierusalem concerning the businesse of Antiochia.</hi> What possibly <hi>we may see</hi> in length and time, is not easie to determine for the present; But I have both more hope and feare of seeing a thousand other things (which yet I cannot certainly say, that I shall see) then I have of either, ever to see Classicall proceedings demonstrated out of that passage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nor doth <hi>A. S.</hi> so much as put forth his little finger towards such a Demonstration, but contents himselfe (for the present) to threaten us with his own <hi>hope,</hi> of <hi>seeing</hi> the business <hi>cleerly demonstrated to us by a better hand ere long. Cleere demonstrations</hi> of any thing from the Scriptures, shall be very wellcome to us at any time; but me thinks I see such insuperable difficulties in the way, that I feare that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> will never come out cleere. Yet because I would helpe forward the <hi>Cleernesse</hi> of it, what I can, I shall make bold to propound unto him that either is, or shall be, the undertaker thereof, a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which (I humbly conceive) must be substantially prov'd, to make the <hi>Demonstration cleere,</hi> at least to me, and many others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It must be prov'd, that the Apostles, in that meeting at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 6. sate there onely in the capacitie of ordinary Elders or Presbyters, and not as Apostles. <hi>i.</hi> that they wav'd or silenc'd the spirit of infallibilitie which was given them, and fell to worke with the weake and fallible spirits of other men. Which is, as if a man should pull out his eyes, to see with the holes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It must further be prov'd, that this councell at Hierusalem had their state and set times of meeting, as weekly, monethly, yeerely, or the like, and that they did not assemble occasionally onely. For this is one of the high characters of Presbyterie, by <hi>A. S.</hi> his owne calculation. <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It must yet be proov'd, that they had <hi>Authoritatem citationis,</hi> an authoritative power to cite &amp; call before them, whom they pleas'd, within the pale of Apostolicall Jurisdiction, that is, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the whole world.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:196665:35"/>
               <p n="4"> 4. It must also be made cleere, that the Apostles and Elders that were members of this Synod, were sent hereunto, by those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, over whom they had right to claime Jurisdiction, or intended to include in their determinations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Demonstration</hi> will never be <hi>cleere,</hi> till it be substantially prov'd, that there was none authorized to fit in that Councell, but onely Church-Officers and Ecclesiasticall men; the contrary hereof seeming (at least) very apparant, from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. &amp; 23.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That likewise must not be left unprov'd, that this Councell had power, as well to make new Laws of indifferent things, as to impose things necessary upon the Churches, <hi>ver.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Demonstrator to make his worke <hi>cleere</hi> and clever, must proove that the Churches of Syria and Cilicia, had their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners or Delegates, sitting Authoritatively in this Synod, because they are included in the Determination, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It must be prov'd likewise, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> sate as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners upon the same terms for the Church of Antioch in this Synod.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It must be made to appeare, either that this Synod or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, would have proceeded as now they did, whether they could have said, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us,</hi> or no, or that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Synods or Assemblies may lawfully proceed as they did, though they have no such assurance of a concurrence of the Holy Ghost with them, as they had.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And lastly, Proofe must be made, that those words in the close of the Epistle (sent from this Councell to the respective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) <hi>yee shall doe well,</hi> ver. 29. are fulminative, and import some such threatning or intimation as this, that if they did not submit, some further course must be taken with them.</p>
               <p>If all these particulars, shall be substantially cleered and proved, I shall freely acknowledge that there is a plausible <hi>patterne</hi> for <hi>A. S.</hi> his Government, in the new Testament, but <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus est.</hi> I shall not pre-judge any mans abilities; but for the present, I doe as much expect the fulfilling of that Poeticall Prophecie,
<q>Ʋnda dabit flammas, &amp; dabit ignis aquas,</q> as I doe ever to see that fifteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> safely deliver'd of the man-child call'd <hi>Presbyterie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>A. S.</hi> must pardon us if as yet we be not able to see any
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:196665:36"/> patterne at all of his Government, neither <hi>formall,</hi> nor <hi>materiall,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>explicit,</hi> nor <hi>implicit,</hi> either in the old or new Testament.</p>
               <p>Well, but yet the man hath one string to his bowe more; though <hi>Grace</hi> will not relieve him, it may be <hi>nature</hi> will. He hath (as he saith) <hi>a pattern in the Law of Nature, which will suffice.</hi> They must (I beleeve) have verie good appetites to Presbyterie, that will be suffic'd with this pattern. The Law of nature is a very vast volume, and <hi>A. S.</hi> hath not quoted either page, leaf, or section of the book, so that I know not whither to turn, or where to look for his pattern. But me thinks the man himself hath given ample testimonie to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> that it is no wayes guiltie of, or accessarie to his Presbyterian Government. For that which cannot be made out, to the judgements and consciences of men, without the help of such an host of schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique, intricate, (if not inexplicable) distinctions, as <hi>A. S.</hi> is fain to leavie, and muster together, <hi>p.</hi> 29. 30. 31. 32. &amp;c. before he can make either head or foot of his businesse, what other originall or descent soever it may claim, I know not, but (questionlesse) <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> will not own. The Law of nature saith with one of natures sons; <hi>Odi difficiles nugas:</hi> she meddles not with subtilties, niceties, or curiosities of distinctions. A man that is unlearned, and but of ordinarie capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, that shall read the pages last quoted, may very possibly take his odde and uncouth distinctions for names of unclean spirits, and think that the man conjur's for his Government.</p>
               <p>But will you please to hear the names of his beagles, with which he follows his game, and hunts classique Law out of those deep and dark caverns and tullians of the earth where Nature had hid it, <hi>stigiis{que} admoverat umbris.</hi> The first couple, <hi>Actus primus, senior,</hi> and <hi>Actus secundus, senior.</hi> The second couple; <hi>Actus primus junior,</hi> and <hi>Actus secundus, junior.</hi> The third, <hi>Actus primus, tertius;</hi> and <hi>Actus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus, tertius.</hi> The fourth, <hi>Actus signatus, senior, Actus exercitus, senior.</hi> The fift, <hi>Actus signatus, junior;</hi> and <hi>Actus exercitus, junior.</hi> The sixt, <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectivè</hi> and <hi>distributivè.</hi> The seventh, <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>materially.</hi> The eight, <hi>Totum simpliciter,</hi> and <hi>totum &amp; totaliter.</hi> The ninth, <hi>Omne simpliciter pro omne</hi> and <hi>pro omni &amp; omnino vel omnimodo.</hi> The tenth, <hi>Totum, tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> and <hi>totum modificatum.</hi> The eleventh, <hi>Divisim &amp; conjunctim.</hi> The twelfth, <hi>per se,</hi> and <hi>per accidens:</hi> The thirteenth and last, <hi>Totum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusum,</hi> and <hi>totum ordinatum.</hi> Can any reasonable man imagine, that that conclusion or practise, which cannot be justified or cleared to the understanding and conscience of learned, pregnant and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive men (for these are no lettuces for illiterate lips) but by the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:196665:36"/> contributions and engagements of all these distinctions (&amp; some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not listed) should be sufficiently conteined in the <hi>Law of nature?</hi> The <hi>Law of nature</hi> is a book for every mans reading and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but this volume of distinctions is scarce for any mans. If <hi>A. S.</hi> and his partie would but spare the vulgar and common sort of men (as there is neither reason, nor Religion but why they should) from putting their necks under the yoke of Classique Government, untill they can plough with these heifers, I mean till he or they have made them capable of all these distinctions, for my part I should not fear much danger or inconvenience from it, except it were the intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or suspending of such a Government, as might be a benefit and blessing to them, whilest they are in preparing for the other.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we clearly see that all <hi>A. S.</hi> his foundations for his Presbyteriall building, fail him: neither the <hi>old Testament,</hi> nor the <hi>New,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Law of nature,</hi> will consent to bear or to support any such fabrique. Nor is all that hath been here said by way of contest with him about his Government, any whit more then a first fruits of what is further opposeable to it.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>If we cannot upon this advantage of ground, make good this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:196665:37"/> against all opposition, it is very ill bestowed on us, and we deserve to be punished with that, which lifts up it self against it. But,</p>
               <p>First, if <hi>entirenesse</hi> of Government or <hi>jurisdiction</hi> be not to be <hi>denied to a single congregation</hi> when it is solitarie and without neighbours, then certainly it hath a lawfull right, title, or claime to such a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. For whatsoever doth not in a way of equitie or right belong unto any man, ought to be denied unto him. If then a single Church in this case, hath a right to an entirenesse of rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment within it self, I would gladly know, by what right any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, or churches be they never so many, can take away this right or priviledge from it. <hi>Those whom God hath put together</hi> (saith our Saviour in the case of marriage) <hi>let not man put asunder.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse if a single Church, under the circumstance mentioned, hath a <hi>right to an entirenesse of Jurisdiction within it self,</hi> it hath this right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon it by God, or Christ himself, there being no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or foundation thereof imaginable. And if so, then who ever shall take away, or deny this right of Jurisdiction unto it, must shew a commission from heaven to do it, or otherwise be guiltie of <hi>putting those asunder, which God hath joyned together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if a Church yet single, be invested with a power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction within it self, and should be cashiered of this power, by the rising up of more Churches neer unto her, then that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God as a table, should become a snare unto her; she should suffer losse, and have sorrow from those, by whom she ought to be comforted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a single Church should suffer losse of so considerable a priviledge, as entirenesse of Jurisdiction is, by the multiplication of Churches neer unto her, then cannot this Church pray for the propagation of the Gospel in places neer to it, but she must pray against her own comfort and peace; which is a sore temptation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, either to pray very faintly, or not to pray at all, for such a thing.</p>
               <p>If it be objected and said, that entirenesse of Jurisdiction is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or priviledge to a single Church, but rather an inconvenience, or a diminutive priviledge at best, and that her condition shall be improv'd, not impaired, by combining her self in point of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with other Churches: I answer,</p>
               <p>First, that the Scripture it self makes intirenesse of government, or subjection onely unto those that are of the same societie or body, aspeciall mercie, favour, and blessing from God. <hi>And their Nobles</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:196665:37"/>
                  <hi>shall be of themselves</hi> (saith God, speaking of that great goodnesse he meant to shew unto his people after their return from Babylon) <hi>and their Governour shall proceed from the midst of them,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 30. 21. So it is made a character or signe of the prosperous estate of Tyre, <hi>that her wise men that were in her,</hi> (i. of her own Nation) <hi>were her pilots.</hi> Ezek. 27. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, subjection unto strangers, is still spoken of as matter of punishment and sorrow. <hi>Give not thine heritage to reproach, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then should reigne over it.</hi> Joel 2. 17. The nation of the Jews were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly forbidden to <hi>set strangers to rule over them.</hi> Deut. 17. 15.</p>
               <p>If it be objected; but Pastors or Elders of neighbour Churches ought not to be looked upon as strangers, but as Brethren. I answer (in a word) though they be brethren in comparison of the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving partie of the world, and in respect of their spirituall descent from the same Father with them; yet have they more of the relation and consideration of strangers to them, then those that are (as it were) of the same domestique societie with them. And therefore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to them, must needs have lesse of the blessing, and more of the curse in it, then subjection to their own.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the grants of Government and rule within themselves unto Towns and Corporations, were ever esteemed matters of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace and favour from Princes: and have sometimes been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with great summes by the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, reason it self demonstrates intirenesse of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to be a sweet priviledge &amp; benefit to a particular Church. First, in case a man be questioned, he saves a proportion both of time, and labour of travaile in respect of what he must undergo, if he were to make his Answer at a Consistorie further of. Secondly, proceedings against him in his own societie, shall be regulated, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged and ordered, by his own Pastor, who is a Father unto him in the Lord, and who in all reason, and according to the course of (almost) all constant experience, is more tender, affectionate, and compassionate towards him, then the Pastors of other stocks, and those that are strangers to him. The <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that knew <hi>Joseph,</hi> dealt well by him, his kindred, and seed: but (saith the text) <hi>there arose another Pharaoh that knew not Joseph, and he evill intreated our Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, he shall be tried, and sentenced by those, who know not how soon it may be their own case to be tried &amp; sentenced by him again; which in reason cannot but teach them moderation and equitie, in whatsoever they shall act or suggest against him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:196665:38"/> a Consistorie of standing Judges, whose <hi>fair necks</hi> have little or no cause to fear any <hi>yoke</hi> of being judged themselves, are in farre more danger through a confident and constant use of the Scepter, of having their hand hardened, and their little finger soon made as heavie as their loins. It is a good rule which <hi>A. S.</hi> himself prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us withall in this case, p. 10. <hi>Nunquam satis fida potentia, ubi nimia est;</hi> power seldome yeelds any good fruit, where it is too rank and luxuriant. Fourthly, it is a great incouragement and confirmation of face, to a man that is accused, and is call'd to answer for himself, especially if he be any thing tender-foreheaded and bashfull, as many of inferiour breed and education are, to answer before those, whose faces are familiar to him, and with whose persons he is well acquainted; and the contrary is a kind of oppression to such a man. Such an advantage or disadvantage as this, may easily amount to as much, as either a mans standing, or falling in his cause. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory of strange faces, especially the persons being all of superiour rank and qualitie to him, may be to a plain man, of as bad a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, as the seeing of <hi>Medusas</hi> head was (among the Poets) it may turn him into a stone, and make him able to say little for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; whereas if he be to make his answer at home, the knowledge and interest he hath, of and in those persons before whom he is to speak, will be a soveraigne antidote unto him against such fears, as otherwise might betray him in his cause. Fiftly, in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we speak of, by the Congregation, private Christians have the opportunitie of seeing and hearing from time to time, all the carriages, debates, and judiciarie proceedings in the Church, which will be not onely matter of much satisfaction, but also as a school of wisdom and experience unto them daily; whereas, if these trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions be negotiated at a remote Consistorie, the private Christian loseth his portion and interest in them. Sixtly (and lastly) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions many times are verie offensive and hard to be digested, for want of the knowledge of the premisses, that should allay and sweeten them. Classique determinations and awards, especially when they rise high, the reasons and grounds of them being (for the most part) unknown to the generalitie of men, are of hard constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with them: whereas the issues and awards that are brought forth in a Congregation, the whole series and storie of all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>à capite ad calcem,</hi> being known unto all, must needs be much more satisfactory, and of a farre better resentment with men. These reasons might have been inlarged with much more strength and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:196665:38"/> weight, and many others likewise added to them; but for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, desirous we are that brevitie should have the casting voice.</p>
               <p>Who then can lay any thing to the charge of this Government? That can I (quoth <hi>A. S.</hi> in effect. <hi>p.</hi> 38. 39. &amp;c.) I have sixteen reasons or objections against it. Yea but <hi>A. S.</hi> your sixteen Reasons (or at least the greatest part of them, as farr as I can see) have all but one head; and if that be struck off, all those reasons are but as so many <hi>dead corpses.</hi> You alledge against the Apologists, that the <hi>remedie,</hi> in their way of Government, for the reducing of whole Congregations or Churches, in case they miscarrie or be irregular, <hi>is not sufficient, nor satisfactory.</hi> This you prove by laying pen upon paper, untill you had sixteen reasons (so called) in black and white. I shall not spend time in transcribing these your Reasons, but shall desire the Reader (though it may be some discourtesie unto you) to take your book into his hand, and to consider of them with what is repond in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to them.</p>
               <p>And first, for that defectivenesse you charge upon the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Government, for the reduction of whole Churches, under er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, miscarriages, &amp;c. I answer.</p>
               <p>First, Suppose that course or means which the Apologists insist upon, <hi>a with-drawing, and renouncing all Christian communion with such Churches, untill they repent,</hi> be not in the eye of reason or humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture a means <hi>sufficient</hi> for such a purpose, and that not onely six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen but six and twentie reasons, and those more plausible then <hi>A. S.</hi> his sixteen, could be leavied against it, yet if it be a means which God hath authorized for the effecting it (as I verily beleeve it is, neither doth <hi>A. S.</hi> nor any of his, that yet I have met with, prove the contrarie) it will do the deed, and prosper, when as seven other means that are greater of flesh and more promising, will but beat the aire, and do little of what was intended and projected to have been done by them. How many reasons may we probably conceive, that the <hi>disputers of this world</hi> in <hi>Paul's</hi> time, were able to bandie against preaching, whereby to prove it foolishnesse? yet this was, and still is, and ever will be, maugre all the opposition of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand disputations and reasons against it, <hi>the wisdom of God, and the power of God, to save those that beleeve.</hi> The strength and power of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinances, do not lie in their natures, but in their relations or institutions. Now that a <hi>withdrawing of Christian communion</hi> from persons walking inordinately, is an ordinance, or means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, for the reducing and reclaiming of them, is evident,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:196665:39"/> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6. with the 14. <hi>We warn you Brethren in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your selves from every brother that walketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately,</hi> &amp;c. and vers. 14. <hi>If any man obey not this our saying in this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, note him, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi> Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying, that to with-draw communion, and to deny Christian fellowship unto Christians walking inordinately, is both a means of Divine institution, and otherwise proper and commodious in it self, to reclaime and bring them to Repentance. There is the same reason of Churches in this behalf, which there is of persons; Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being nothing else but persons embodied.</p>
               <p>Secondly, suppose there were no such <hi>sufficient or satisfactory remedy</hi> for the inconvenience mentioned in the way of the Apologists, as <hi>A. S.</hi> conceives to be in his (which yet there is, as hath in part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, and will afterwards, further appeare) yet Lawyers have a saying, that <hi>a mischief is better, then an inconvenience.</hi> A man had better run the hazard of a greater losse, then expose himself to a daily wasting and consuming of his estate. A man had better be wet through and through with a soaking showre once a yeer, then be exposed in his house to <hi>continuall droppings</hi> all the yeer long. The Delinquencie of whole Churches, (such I mean as is matter of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique scandall or offence to their neighbour Churches) is not an every dayes case, no more in the way of <hi>congregationall,</hi> then of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall</hi> Government: you acknowledge the raritie of it in your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and we affirm it in ours. Now then much better it is, to want a remedie against such an evill, which possibly may not fall out within an age, though it be greater when it doth fall, then it is to expose our selves <hi>to continuall droppings,</hi> I mean to those daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which we lately shewed to be incident to the Classique Government.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they that implead the Congregationall way, for being defective, as touching the matter in hand, seeme to suppose, that God hath put a sufficiencie of power into the hands of men, to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die all defects, errours, and miscarriages of men whatsoever. Else why should it be made matter of so deep a charge and challenge against the way of the Apologists, that it affords not a <hi>sufficient and satisfactorie remedie</hi> either to prevent or heal all possible miscarriages in all Churches? I would willingly know, in case your <hi>Church trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent,</hi> your supreame Session of Presbyters, should miscarrie, and in your Doctrinall determinations, give us <hi>hay, stubble, and wood,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>silver, gold,</hi> and <hi>precious stones</hi> (a misprision, you know, well
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:196665:39"/> neer as incident, to such Assemblies, yea and to those that are more generall and oecumenicall then so, as obstinacie in errour is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregations) what remedie the poore Saints and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God under you have, or can expect against such a mischief; or what remedie you now have in the way of your Government, for the recovering of your selves out of such a snare, more then what the congregationall way affordeth, for the reclaiming of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches. Nay the truth is, your Government in such a case is at a greater losse in respect of any probable or hopefull remedie against such an evill (which yet is an evill of a most dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence) then the other way of Government is for the reduction of particular Churches. That hath the <hi>remedie</hi> of God (as hath been shewed), though not the <hi>remedie</hi> of men, and yet that <hi>remedie</hi> of God which it hath, is appliable by men, and those known who they are, <hi>viz.</hi> the Churches of Christ neer adjoyning; but if your great Ecclesiastique bodie be tainted or infected though never so <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Corpora mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis majora patent.</hi> Sen.</note> dangerously, God must have <hi>mercie on you,</hi> and that in a way some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what (at least) more then ordinarie, if ever you be healed. For that <hi>Directive power in matters of Religion,</hi> which, had you left it in other mens hands, might in this case, through the blessing of God, have healed you, being now onely in your own, hath not onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned that evill disease that is upon you, but also leaves you helplesse and curelesse by other men. <hi>A. S.</hi> makes the greatest part of his arguments against that way of Government which he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, of <hi>what iffs,</hi> I mean of loose and impertinent suppositions, and cases, that are not like to fall out, till <hi>ursa major</hi> and <hi>ursa minor</hi> meet (unto which kind of arguments every whit as much as enough hath been answered alreadie) but he shall shew himself a soveraigne Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactour indeed to the Presbyterian cause, if he can find out <hi>a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die satisfactorie and sufficient</hi> against that sore evill we speak of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his Government in the case mentioned: which is a case both of a farre worse consequence then the obstinacie of a particular Church in some errour; and (I fear) of a far more frequent occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then the world is willing to take notice of.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let us ponder a little, how <hi>sufficient and satisfactorie</hi> that <hi>remedie</hi> against the evill now in consideration, is, which the Classique politie, under the protection of <hi>A. S.</hi> his pen, so much glorieth in; let us compare the two remedies, of the two corriving polities toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>A. S.</hi> hath done, after his manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Presbyteriall Government</hi> (saith he, p. 39.) <hi>is subject to none of</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:196665:40"/>
                  <hi>these inconveniences: For the collective or combined eldership having an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative power, all men and Churches thereof are bound by Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to submit themselves thereunto: Every man knoweth their set times of meeting, wherein sundrie matters are dispatched, and all things carried by pluralitie of voices, without any schisme or seperation.</hi> Not to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the man about his Grammaticals, (wherein his pen slips oftner then <hi>Priscian</hi> will <hi>tolerate</hi> in such a piece) because in these he opposeth nothing but a mans conceit either of overmuch scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or overmuch care, in him.</p>
               <p>Here is a <hi>remedie</hi> indeed against some inconveniences; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inconveniences be not much better then the remedie, <hi>adhuc sub Judice lis est.</hi> But what are the inconveniences?</p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>that Churches being equall in authoritie, one cannot binde another to give any account, in case of offence given.</hi> Well, what is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for this in Classique constitution? <hi>The combined Eldership having an authoritative power, all men and Churches thereof are bound by Law and Covenant to submit themselves,</hi> &amp;c. What is another inconvenience? <hi>In case other Churches were offended in the proceedings of a particular Church, they could not judge in it; for then they should be both judge and partie in one cause, &amp;c.</hi> Well, what is the remedie in Presbyterian politie? <hi>The combined Eldership having an authoritative power, all men and Churches, &amp;c.</hi> What is a third inconvenience? <hi>That Congregationall Government giveth no more power or authoritie to a thousand Churches over one, then to a Tinker, yea to the Hangman over a thousand, &amp;c.</hi> What is the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian remedie for this? <hi>The combined Eldership having an Authoritative power, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>combined Eldership</hi> with their <hi>Authoritative power</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>with a Law or Covenant whereby all men and Churches under them, are bound to submit unto them,</hi> are as bars of iron and gates of brasse to keep out all those inconveniences, irregularities, defilements, pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, out of the Presbyterian Temple, whereunto (it seems) the Congregationall temple, for want of such stoure and tight provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, lies open. But,</p>
               <p>First, what if your <hi>combined Eldership</hi> hath neither footing nor foundation in the Word of God? It is not the serviceablenesse of it against a thousand such inconveniences as were mentioned, that will justifie it. <hi>Sauls</hi> offering sacrifice was a means to prevent the <hi>scattering of the people</hi> from him; yet <hi>Samuel</hi> told him that <hi>he had done foolishly in it;</hi> and it cost him his Kingdom. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 9. 13. 14. So the putting forth of <hi>Vzzah's</hi> hand to stay the Ark, was a means to keep it from being shaken; but yet the doing of it cost him his life. <hi>Peters</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:196665:40"/> valour and zeal in drawing his sword, and laying about him, was a likely means of rescuing his Master; but the Lord Christ preferred the imminent danger of his life before such a rescue, and check'd the sword that was drawn for him again into the sheath. That Law and constitution in the Papacie, whereby <hi>all men, and all Churches thereof,</hi> are bound to submit their judgements in matters of Faith to the decision of the Papall Chair, is as soveraigne a <hi>remedie</hi> against all those inconveniences named, as that for which Classique Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is so much magnified by you; and yet it is never the lesse abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the eyes both of God and men. The Question is not, which Government will serve most turns; but which is most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will and Word of God. If that of Presbyterie be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive this way, as there is extreame cause to fear it is, this defect cannot be recompenced or redeemed by any other commendation whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, neither can we with any tolerable satisfaction inform our selves out of all your discourse, either what you mean by that <hi>Authoritative power,</hi> which you claime to your <hi>combined Eldership,</hi> nor yet how, or by what, or whose Authoritie, they come to be invested with it. As for the power, sometimes you deny it to be <hi>magisteriall,</hi> or such, which may not lawfully be declin'd, when a man cannot submit unto it without disobedience to God; otherwise, you make it so irrefrageably sacred, as if it were no lesser sin then perjurie it self, to detract it. Again, for the investiture of your Eldership with this power, whether they arrogate it unto themselves and are their own earvers, or whether the Civill State and Parliamentarie Law, or whether the free and joynt consent of those over whom this power is exercised, do conferre and derive it upon them, you inform us not, but count an <hi>ignoramus,</hi> better then a verdict. But till you do resolve us by what Authoritie or power this <hi>Authoritative power</hi> comes into the hand of your <hi>combined Eldership,</hi> we shall think it safer to stand to the hazard and damage of all the <hi>inconveniences</hi> spoken of, then to subject to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Law of the State, be the first and most considerable band or tye upon men to submit unto the power of your <hi>combined eldership</hi> (as you seem here to imply, in saying <hi>that all men and all Churches thereof are bound by Law, &amp;c.)</hi> then 1. you must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the root and base of your Government is <hi>potestas secularis,</hi> secular authoritie; and then how is it Ecclesiastique or spirituall? A man may as well <hi>bring a clean thing out of an unclean</hi> (in <hi>Jobs</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:196665:41"/> as make a spirituall extraction out of a secular root. Secondly, it will rest upon you to prove, that the Civill State hath a power to form and fashion the Government of the Churches of Christ. Yea, thirdly (and lastly) it will be demonstratively prov'd against you, that you resolve the Government of the Churches of Christ (in the last resolution of it) into the humours, wils, and pleasures of the world, yea of the vilest and most unworthie of men. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and lastly) the <hi>Authoritative power of your combined El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership</hi> being granted unto you, we do not see how the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences you find in the Congregationall way, will be much better salv'd in yours. For first, what if a particular Congregation under the jurisdiction of your Eldership, reflecting upon the Oath or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it hath taken for subjection thereunto, (as likewise upon all other ingagements that way) as unlawfull, shall peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to stand to the awards or determinations of it, what will you do in this case? How will your <hi>combined Eldership remedie</hi> this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience? What? will you excommunicate this Church? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists in their way do little lesse; (and that by a power farre lesse questionable then yours) nay in your interpretation, they do everie whit as much? Or will you deliver them over <hi>Brachio seculari?</hi> to be hamper'd and taught better, then it seems you can teach them, by prisons, fines, banishment, &amp;c. O <hi>A. S.</hi> remember you tax'd the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists, for comporting in a very small matter (in comparison) with the Arminians (in case it had been true) and will you comply with the Papists in a matter of this high nature? Churches had need take heed how they chuse men for their guardians, that will so dispose of them, if they please them not. Besides, you know what was said in the second Chapter, touching the power of the Magistrate in this case. And what if in the Session of your <hi>combined Eldership</hi> there be no such thing as pluralitie of votes concerning the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of such a Church, (as it is very possible that in such a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth may find just as many friends as errour hath, and no more) is not the <hi>remedie</hi> you spake of now in the dust?</p>
               <p>Again, secondly, (to touch upon the second inconvenience men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) when your <hi>combined Eldership</hi> proceeds against a particular Church amongst you, upon offence taken, is not this Eldership as well <hi>party,</hi> as <hi>Judge?</hi> If you think you have every whit the better of it, because your eldership, though it be both <hi>party,</hi> and <hi>judge,</hi> yet hath an <hi>authoritative power,</hi> over those whom it judgeth. I answer, first, that as our Saviour told <hi>Pilate; He could have no power against him,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:196665:41"/>
                  <hi>except it were given him from above;</hi> no more can your Eldership have over those, whom it judgeth in this case. Now how uncertain and faint the probabilities are, that they have any power over them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them <hi>from above,</hi> hath been formerly shewed at large. And if that power which your Eldership claimeth, and exerciseth over the Church arraigned, be not <hi>from above,</hi> then the Apologists <hi>remedie</hi> is farre better and safer, then yours. Secondly, to hold and maintain, that all those that have an <hi>Authoritative power</hi> over men, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by vertue of such power, be both parties and judges, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt all manner of tyrannie, violence, and oppression by a Law. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a supposition, men invested with Authoritie and power whether in Church or State, may be their own carvers, and serve themselves of the estates, liberties and lives, of those that are under them, how, and when, and as oft as they list. And why do you not submit to the decisive judgement of the King in all controversies depending between you and him, if that be your Doctrine?</p>
               <p>For the third inconvenience (so called) I shall be your debtour to tell me plainly and distinctly, what power more your Government giveth to a <hi>thousand Churches over one, then to a Tinker, or the Hangman, over a thousand.</hi> I do not remember where either your self or any of your partie, have calculated the proportion; but I well remember a saying in <hi>Charron; That every humane proposition hath equall authoritie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tout proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion humaine a autant d'authorite quel'autre, si la raison n'on fait la diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron de sagesse. Plus creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioni alicujus simplicis &amp; non authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zati excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis eruditi, quam decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationi Papae.</note>
                  <hi>if reason make not the difference:</hi> and another of <hi>Gerson</hi> (much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Protestant Authors, though the Author of it Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) <hi>The saying of a simple man and no wayes authoriz'd, if he be well seen in the Scriptures, is rather to be beleeved then the Popes own determination.</hi> But <hi>A. S.</hi> what makes you think (for I can easily guesse what makes you say) that the Government of the Apologists <hi>gives no more power to a thousand Churches over one, then to a Tinker or Hangman over a thousand? Ʋbi, quando, quibus testibus,</hi> did this Government, or any son it hath, ever make any such comparison, or so farre honour either your <hi>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> or <hi>hangman,</hi> as to make them equall in power <hi>to a thousand Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> And yet I suppose, if a man should say, that the dust in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, hath as much life in it, as the Sun, it would be no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this excellent and glorious creature; because the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of it, doth not stand in any degrees or superioritie of life above any other creature, but in the abundance of light which it hath, and the height of it's scituation, and the serviceablenesse of it to the world by means of both. In like manner if it be supposed (which, I think upon what hath been delivered, may very reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:196665:42"/> be supposed) that the glorie and excellencie of Churches doth not stand in any <hi>power or authoritie</hi> that one hath over an other, or many over one, but in other farre more rich, and holy, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able endowments, relations, and qualifications, it can be no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or disparagement unto <hi>ten thousand</hi> of them, to say they have no more authoritie over one, then <hi>A. S.</hi> his <hi>tinker</hi> or <hi>hangman</hi> hath over them. Therefore if <hi>A. S.</hi> his admired piece of Church-policie hath no greater commendation, then to serve for preventing such <hi>inconveniences</hi> as this, the world needs make no great lamentation over it, though it were in the condition of <hi>Rachels children,</hi> when she <note place="margin">Matth. 2. 18.</note>
                  <hi>wept</hi> for them, and <hi>would not be comforted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some other <hi>inconveniences</hi> there are, wherein <hi>A. S.</hi> finds the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he opposeth, tardie, and thinke he sets a crown of glorie upon the head of his Presbyterie, in vindicating the <hi>innocencie</hi> of it in respect of such guilt; but alas, he washeth off this guilt with blood, or with water fouler then it (as hath been shewed) and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth</hi> his Government in that wherein he mainly <hi>alloweth</hi> it. The guilt is innocencie, in respect of the purgation. There is one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience (formerly opened and insisted upon in this Chapter) verie incident to Presbyterie, the conscience whereof (me thinks) should make all the sons of that way, rather to cover and compassionate, then to complain or cry out of, any inconvenience, they either see, or rather think they see in another.</p>

Sixtly, have (many of them) such as were meet for such a service, adventur'd their persons and lives, in the face of the rage and furie of the common enemie, continuing still in the same ingagements; yea seventhly (and lastly) have (some of them) exposed themselves to more danger and harder termes from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse partie, then ordinarie (in case they should prevail) by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vindication of the cause of the Parliament in print from the Scriptures, and that before any man of differing judgement from them in Church affairs, appeared in the cause upon such terms; that any man (I say) on this side of malignancie, should consult the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, trouble, disgrace, suppression, ruine of men, so holy, so harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, of such eminent desert in the cause of Religion, State, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, me thinks should exceed the line of humanitie, and be thought some inspiration or suggestion from the great enemie of mankind.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse, if either God, reason, the peace or safetie of the Kingdom, require the sorrows or sufferings of these men, I make no question but they will be willing to dispence with all considerations whatsoever that stand up to plead their immunitie, and will with <hi>Isaac,</hi> patiently suffer themselves to be bound, yea and to be offered up in sacrifice also, if need be. Onely their humble request and suit is, that they may not be sacrificed upon the service of the ignorance, vain surmises, needlesse jealousies, bitter suggestions, whether of a few, or of many. Better a thousand times is it, that such distempers as these, though found in millions of men, should suffer, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so deep, then that the least hair of the head of one of those men should fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>One <hi>A. S.</hi> (it seems) is come forth with a band of one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Reasons, to attach the libertie of these men, and to seize the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their consciences, and comforts for the use of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:196665:43"/> though his word be, <hi>For God and his Countrey.</hi> But let us give him an unpartiall hearing of what he hath to say: if the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie hath right either to the liberties or comforts of these men, God forbid that any man should deny them unto it.</p>
               <p>We shall take the Allegations, into consideration, in that order that himself presents them, in <hi>pa.</hi> 61. 62. 63. 64. 65. of his Discourse; desiring the Reader once more, to read the tenour of them more at large from his own pen, because I intend my Answer, with as little transcribing as may be.</p>
               <p>To the first we answer, first, that we are no wayes able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, why or how the toleration of the Apologists and theirs, should <note place="margin">A. S. his first Reason against Toleration, Answered.</note>
                  <hi>open</hi> any <hi>doore to all sorts of erroneous opinions,</hi> any whit more then <hi>A. S.</hi> his intertaining of a sober and discreet servant to wait upon him, should open a doore to all the Kings guard to become his houshold attendants: or then an allowance of provender to his friends horse, should open a doore to all Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> troops to rack and manger with him. (Nay secondly, we are verily perswaded (and that upon good grounds) that the granting unto the Apologists a free exercise of their ministery, will (under God) be an effectuall means both of chasing away many erroneous opinions, which are (for the present) fighting against the truth of God amongst us; as also of preventing the coming on of further supplies from Hell unto them. <hi>A. S.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gives them this testimony, <hi>p.</hi> 70. that <hi>whoever knows them, knows well they want no abilities to dispute their opinion in any Assembly in Europe.</hi> Men of their abilities, being sound and orthodox in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments withall, are carpenters prepared (as it were) on purpose by God, for the cutting down of the horns of false doctrines and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, if they be suffered to work.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, (and lastly) if the worst should come to the worst (as the saying is) better <hi>a doore opened to all sorts of erroneous opinions,</hi> yea and to many other inconveniences greater then this, then that the guilt of any persecution or of any evill intreatings of the Saints and servants of God should cleave unto a people or State.</p>
               <p>To your second Alledgement, why no Toleration for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Answer to his second Reason</note> we answer, first, that the very constitution of it is but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiousnesse of fear: <hi>The shadow of the mountains seem men unto you. It may breed factions and divisions between persons of whatsoever relation,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Iudg. 9.</note>
                  <hi>May</hi> (the countrey Proverbe saith) <hi>comes but once a yeer;</hi> but that <hi>may</hi> this proverb speaks of, <hi>must</hi> come so oft; but <hi>A. S.</hi> his <hi>May, may</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly not come in an age, no nor in many generations. And would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:196665:43"/> he have so many thousands of the deare children and servants of God, as do Apologize in the Land, actually and out of hand, be compelled to eat their bread in darknesse, to be filled with heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and many of them (it is like) to perish by hunger, nakednesse, &amp;c, for the honour and exaltation of his <hi>May be?</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Non Dea te genuit, sed duris cautibus horrens</l>
                     <l>Gaucasus, hyrcanae{que} admorunt ubera tygres.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>The man speaks as if he had been bred of rocks, and suck'd the milk of Tygers.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Doth he not deserve to be beaten with his own rod? and because his writing books, <hi>may</hi> cause many troubles and distractions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, not to be <hi>tolerated</hi> to have pen, ink, or paper any more?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I would know of him, whether he deemeth himself to be of an <hi>other Religion</hi> then the Apologists, because he dissents in judgement from them about Church Government. If so, he must deem himself either Arminian, Papist, Socinian, or worse; if not, then <hi>Candorem tuum A. S.</hi> in that malignant expression, whereby you would make simple people beleeve, that <hi>the father and the son, and so the husband and wife, are of different Religions,</hi> when they do not walk in the same way of Church Discipline.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, why should such a difference as this, at least a libertie thus to differ, without smarting on either side, <hi>breed factions or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions between persons in relation? Doth the wilde asse bray</hi> (saith <hi>Job) when</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 6. 5.</note>
                  <hi>he hath grasse? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</hi> Surely persons are never upon better terms of advantage to agree, then when contentment is injoyed on every side. Or in case of such a difference as we speak of, if it be matter of discontent to one partie, that the other is not of the same practise with him, you may confidently beleeve that the miscarriage in this kind rests on the Presbyterian side; the spirit thereof inordinately lusting after unitie in practise, <hi>viz.</hi> whether ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any unitie in judgement or no, yea or whether there be any ground for it or no, on the dissenting side. You may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of troubles and distractions likely to arise in families and other relations, with somewhat the lesse danger of miscarrying in your predictions, if you animate or incourage those that are, or shal be of your party, to make the fray. As I have read a story of a wizard in France, who foretold the death of the Duke of Burgundie upon a certain day; and to make himself a true Prophet, when the day came, murthered him himself.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:196665:44"/>
               <p n="4"> 4. Suppose <hi>A. S.</hi> should have the apples given him which his soule lusteth after, and no toleration granted, would there not be as much if not more, reason to feare factions and divisions between Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and Subject, Husband and wife, &amp;c. as otherwise? If God should not incline the judgement, or not satisfie the conscience of the one of these parties in relation, concerning the lawfulnesse of that Government Presbyterial, which we suppose (for argument sake) to be established without a toleration of any other, would not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aggrieved and burthened in this kinde, be (in all likelihood) worse company for the other, more troubled, more discontented, and every whit as much divided both in judgement and practise from him, yea and more divided in affection, discontentment being one of the greatest enemies that are, to love, union, and peace. Were it not a thousand times better, and more conducing unto unitie in affection and peace, rather to suffer the discontented partie to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to burne, I mean, to enjoy the freedome of their conscience, rather then to be perpetually kept in an iron chaine of spirituall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. We cannot but know that relations were incumbred with such factions and divisions, as <hi>A. S.</hi> speaks of, even whilst the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Samaria stood, I mean, when Episcopacie reigned, when yet there was no toleration of Pluralities of Church-government (though of Church-livings there was.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nothing is more frequent in and about the Citie, then for mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same familie, to addresse themselves to severall Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from time to time, the husband to heare in one place, the wife in another, the child in a third, for their better spirituall accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations respectively, yea, and sometimes to communicate with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ministers, without the least breach or touch of discontentment on any side.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And lastly, It can hardly be expected, especially in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where the godly and understanding partie have so long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that in extremitie, from a peremptory imposed State-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without any relaxation or mitigation, and have lately tasted the unexpressible sweetnesse of ease, peace, and libertie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that they should without extreme discontent be brought back into another house of bondage, where the furnace of peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie subjection is like to be het every whit as hot, as in the other. Excellency of teaching, and that abundant light of the knowledge of God, which hath shined from the Ministery amongst us, into the hearts of many thousands, have made the conscience very soft and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:196665:44"/> tender in many. And where conscience is tender, a little violence is a great torment to it.</p>
               <p>To <hi>A. S.</hi> his third reason, to prove the intolerablenesse of a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <note place="margin">His third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note> we answer, that the inward parts of it are but vanitie and falshood. For 1. It supposeth that malignant supposition we spake of, <hi>viz.</hi> that Presbyterie and Apologisme, make two differing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. 2. That there is <hi>no State in Christendome, where there is one onely Religion established, that will admit the publick exercise of any other;</hi> which is manifestly untrue, as is notoriously knowne in France, the Low Countries, &amp;c. 3. And lastly, It supposeth, that Apologisme, in case it be tolerated, must needs become a Schisme in that Religion which is established in the Land. Wee conceive, that every difference in judgement, doth not make a schisme in that Religion which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed on both sides; we shall then find abundance of the weed grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Presbyterian field it selfe. I my selfe know differences not a few amongst that partie; and some not of the lightest consequence. Or if his meaning be, that the practise of it, in case of a Toleration, should become a <hi>Schisme</hi> from the Presbyterian Church or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we answer, 1. That as yet we have no Presbyterian Church or Government amongst us; and so, if the toleration be granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such a Government be established, it is apparantly <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, out of the reach of such an imputation for ever. 2. If it be not a schisme before, and without a toleration, I doe not apprehend what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or aspect a Toleration should have upon it, to make it one. 3. And lastly, I conceive him to be an incompetent Judge, uncapable of knowing or determining what a scisme is, who acknowledgeth his ignorance or non-knowledge of what a Church is, which is a <hi>A. S.</hi> his profession or confession (which you will) <hi>pag.</hi> 21. <hi>And in this also we confesse our ignorance, that we know not wherein consisteth it's es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or being</hi> (speaking of a Church) I cannot beleeve that he should perfectly know the nature of darknesse, that is ignorant of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to light; nor that he should know what death is, who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant wherein life consisteth; nor that he should know what a <hi>schisme</hi> or rent means, that knows not what belongs to the unitie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirenesse of the body. The rule among the sons of Reason, in all such cases as these, is this; <hi>Rectum est index sui &amp; obliqui;</hi> And againe, that <hi>entia privativa cognoscuntue ex suis positivis, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your fourth Reason, is rather somewhat else then a Reason; a <note place="margin">His fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note> confession of the dimnesse or weaknesse of your sight. <hi>I cannot see</hi> (say you) <hi>how</hi> (a Toleration) <hi>can well be denied to other Sects, if it be granted to our Brethren:</hi> But</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:196665:45"/>
               <p n="1"> 1. Doe you remember, how you quip your Brethren (as heer you call them) for a like expression us'd by them, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>If yee see no Scripture for it, yet others</hi> (you tell them) <hi>may see.</hi> So heer we tell you, that though <hi>you cannot see how</hi> a Toleration <hi>can well be denied to other Sects, if it should be granted unto your Brethren,</hi> yet others may see how very well it may. <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is much that you should not be able to <hi>see</hi> such a thing as this, who have such command over your eyes (as was noted formerly) as to see what you will. Is it a matter of such profound and difficult speculation, to conceive, how he that hath the keeping of a doore with lock and key and bolts to it, should let in one man that knocks, without letting in all comers?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas you determine it to be a <hi>Question inextricable, to expound cleerly, what sects and what opinions are to be tolerated, and what not,</hi> doe you not prevaricate with your owne cause and confidence, and put the Magistrate to a stand, whether he should tolerate your opinion for Presbyterian Government, or not? Nay, doe you not put him out of all hope of ever coming to a cleere resolution of what is his dutie to doe in this kind? For what patent can you shew from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why this Opinion of yours should not abide the test and triall of that Law, which heer you impose upon others? I beleeve there are very few either sects or opinions amongst us (in both which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we abound more then is for our comfort) that either are liable to more considerable and materiall exceptions, or that have been dealt with by an higher hand of opposition and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then this of yours. And why any one opinion which is in the same or greater condemnation of unsatisfactorinesse and ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then others, should magnifie it selfe to rule all others with a rod of iron, and to breake them in pieces like a potters vessell, equitie or reason (for my part) I know none: and I feare <hi>A. S.</hi> himselfe is as poore in this commoditie, as I.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it be so <hi>inextricable a Question, to expound cleerely, what sects and opinions are to be tolerated, and what not,</hi> how will you doe to sway your Presbyterian Scepter with judgement and equitie? How will you know what opinions <hi>donare ecclesiâ,</hi> to make free denizans of your Church, and what to disfranchise? By your own rule it is an <hi>inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Question, cleerly</hi> to determine <hi>what opinions are to be tolerated, and what not.</hi> And if the Question be so difficult above measure, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what opinions are to be <hi>tolerated, and what not,</hi> it must needs be yet of a farre more difficult and weightie consideration, to resolve
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:196665:45"/> what are fit to be countenanced, to be established, yea, and yet more, to be imposed, to be enforced upon the judgements and consciences of men, <hi>and what not;</hi> toleration being an act of a farre lighter impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then either an establishment, or an enforcement.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And lastly, Whereas he addes (in the close of this reason) that <hi>the lesse the difference be, the greater is the schisme,</hi> and add's no more; I marvaile who he thinks will enterteine such a saying, the old Writ of <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> being out of date long agoe? yet the saying somewhat confirmes me in what I said before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the man knows not what belongs to a <hi>schisme.</hi> For doth he heer by a <hi>schisme</hi> understand any thing that is sinfull? Then he makes the lesser difference from the truth, to be a greater sin, then a greater would be. If his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, that the lesse materiall the ground or reason of any mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting from a major part be, the greater is his fault or sin in dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; We answer, that his argument proceeds, not onely <hi>à non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessis,</hi> but also <hi>à non concedendis:</hi> for to dissent from a major part, though the grounds of a mans dissent be no matters of deep conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, yet if they be such wherein his judgement and conscience are not satisfied, his dissent is no <hi>sin</hi> at all, and consequently cannot be the <hi>greater sin.</hi> Gnats must not be swallowed for any mans sake, more then camels.</p>
               <p>To his fifth Reason, we answer. First, that suppose <hi>God in the Old</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His fift Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note>
                  <hi>Testament granted no Toleration of divers Religions, or Disciplines,</hi> doth it follow from hence, that you should grant none neither? Dare you say in matters of knowledge, authoritie and power, <hi>Ero similis altis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo,</hi> you will be like the Highest? Remember the fall of the <hi>son of the morning.</hi> Will you set your treshold by Gods, and compare with him for excellencie of knowledge, or infallibilitie of discerning? If you could assure us after the rate of a Divine assurance, that that <hi>Religion and Discipline</hi> which you would impose on us, are in all points sound, and justifiable in the sight of God, we could much better bear the height of your indignation against a Toleration of any Discipline or opinions but your own.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though God granted no such Toleration (as you speak of) <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet he straightly prohibited all manner of violence, oppression, and hard measure among his people one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in speciall manner charged it upon the consciences of the rich, not to take any advantage of the povertie of their Brethren, to exact upon them, enslave them, and the like. Though such Laws as these, in the letter of them, respected onely civill transactions
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:196665:46"/> and dealings between men, yet the equitie and spirit of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to spirituals also, men being every whit as liable to violence, oppression, and hard measure from men for their conscience sake, as in any other respects or upon any other grounds whatsoever. Therefore in case there had been a minor partie in that Nation, that had been of a peculiar judgement by themselves, about the sence and meaning of such or such a Law, relating unto practise (as Laws generally do, in one kind or other) and so had dissented in this practise from the major part of their brethren in their Nation; in case this major part had taken the advantage of their brethrens weaknesse, and because they were fewer in number, should have forc'd them against the light of their judgements, to alter their practise, or if they refused, should have troden and trampled upon them, or any wayes evill intreated them, it had been as apparant a breach of the Laws, we spake of, as any oppression or violence in civill proceedings. And the truth is, that for men that are truly conscientious, civill libertie (as it is called) <hi>i.</hi> freedome from ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall taxes, impositions, exactions, imprisonments, without libertie of conscience, is an accommodation of little value; yea without this, such men are not capable of much ease or benefit by the other. They are still in danger of hearing in trouble and molestation from the State, for their conscience sake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though God gave no such Toleration (as you speake of) by a Law, yet he did actually tolerate for a long time together with much patience, not onely a minor, but a major part of the Jewish Nation, in a manner the whole Nation, and that not onely in some opinions or practises, which were disputably false or sinfull, but even in such which were notoriously and unquestionably such. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 13. 18.) <hi>He suffered</hi> (or, tolerated) <hi>their manners in the Wildernesse fourtie yeeres;</hi> and afterwards in the land of Canaan, many and many a yeere longer, even <hi>till there was no remedie,</hi> (as the Scripture somewhere speaketh.) So then if you be willing to follow the practise and example of God (an honour whereunto you secure to pretend in this Reason) you must <hi>tolerate</hi> your Brethren, not onely in some opinions and practises, which are dialectically and topical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evill, but even in those which are demonstratively such.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And lastly, Whereas you adde, that <hi>the New Testament requireth no lesse union among Christians, then the Old did amongst the Jews,</hi> we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth of what you say, but the pertinencie of it to your purpose we yet desire. Though the <hi>new Testament requires union</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:196665:46"/>
                  <hi>amongst Christians,</hi> and that very ardently and pressingly, yet it doth not require him that is stronger, to cudgell him that is weaker, into the same opinion with him. If you be of a better growth and stature in knowledge then we, and comprehend such truths as we doe not yet understand, we are most willing, as farre and as fast, as meat and nourishment will doe it, to grow up unto you; onely we would not be rack'd or stretch'd to the same stature or proportion with you. We shewed in our second Chapter, what means the New Testament hath appointed and sanctified, for the effecting of the unitie amongst the Saints, which it requireth of them.</p>
               <p>For your sixth Reason (so called) we can scarce see the face of a <note place="margin">His sixt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> Reason in it. You say, that if <hi>your Brethren do assent to your Doctrine, and are resolved likewise to assent to your Discipline, which shall be established by common consent, they need no other toleration then the rest.</hi> If your meaning be, that in case <hi>they assent to your Doctrine, and are resolved to assent to your Discipline, viz.</hi> immediately and out of hand, as soon as it comes from under the hammer, and hath but the stamp of Presbyteriall Authoritie set upon it, we are clearly of your mind, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how or why they should need any other alteration, then what others have. Onely we somewhat marvell that you should so farre forget your self, as to imply (by this your expression) that even your Presbyterian partie it self standeth <hi>in need of a toleration,</hi> as well as ours. <hi>Iam sumus ergo pares.</hi> Truth (I see) is sometimes too quick and cunning for her adversaries. But if your meaning be, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution <hi>in your Brethren</hi> (the Apologists) <hi>to assent to your Discipline, viz.</hi> when, and assoon as they can possibly satisfie themselves touching the lawfulnesse of it, will exempt them from a necessitie of a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, both they (we suppose) and our selves shall be very glad to hear such tydings from your pen. We make no question but they are as throughly <hi>resolved to assent to your Discipline</hi> upon such terms, as you can desire them.</p>
               <p>That you adde, is very incongruous. <hi>It would first be discussed</hi> (say you) <hi>wherein they are resolved to dissent.</hi> First, we marvell who you mean should <hi>discusse</hi> that wherein they should be <hi>resolved to dissent:</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally considering, secondly, that they do not use to take up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions beforehand, not so much as to dissent at all, muchlesse wherein or about what they shall dissent. Thirdly, how should they resolve beforehand, wherein, or whereabout to dissent, except they could prophecie of your future thoughts and resolutions.</p>
               <p>You would further have it <hi>considered</hi> (but you tell us not here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

We grant that other men of good abilities, conscience and learning, may draw up a very satisfactory resolution concerning such or such a case, or practise, about which I am scrupul'd; but it will not follow from hence, that therefore this resolution will be satisfactorie unto me, or that I with a good conscience may walk by it. Though the particular reason or reasons, one or more, upon which the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists shall refuse to entertain such a communion with you, as you mean (or at least should mean, if you speak any thing to purpose) should be by never so many, and upon never so much consideration, adjudged as insufficient or inconsiderable to cause any such refuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in them; yet this will not impose a necessitie upon them, to joyn in communion with you, except you can make them capable of a sufficiencie of reason in such a resolution why they may with a good conscience submit unto it.</p>
               <p>To your seventh Reason, we answer, first, that though the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists <note place="margin">His 7th Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note> should <hi>not be pressed to be actors in anything against their consciences,</hi> yet there is a necessitie lying upon them <hi>to be suiters for a toleration,</hi> (I mean, in case it will not be granted them without suing for, which would be a greater honour to your Presbyterie, then the contrarie peremptorinesse is like to be) <hi>viz.</hi> that so they may be actors of good, according to their consciences. Suppose <hi>A. S.</hi> had bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherewith to subsist, but withall had a good summe of money due to him, and that from one that was very well able to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwise had an opportunitie to preferre himself to some place of profit, credit, or the like, if he would but become a suitor for it; would he think that <hi>he had no need</hi> either to require his money of him in whose hand it lies, or to sue for such preferment? The Apologists conceive there is a necessitie upon them, to save the souls of others, yea of as many as they can lawfully purchase an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to save, as well as their own. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, we know not by what Authoritie or interest you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to secure them, <hi>that they shall not be pressed to be actors in any thing against their consciences.</hi> It may be you are but of the ordinarie Presbyterian stature and pitch, and so <hi>your mercies</hi> though somewhat severe, yet possibly may not be very <hi>cruell:</hi> But (saith the Scripture) <hi>in those dayes there were Gyants in the earth,</hi> as well as men of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly (and lastly) we conceive this promise of yours to them, <hi>that they shall not be pressed to be actors,</hi> &amp;c. to be broken by your self seven times over in your discourse, and by others of your partie from time to time. To consent unto your Government, is (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) to act against their conscience; otherwise, they had no reason to dissent from it. And whether to threaten them with a non-tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, together with all the evils and miseries attending thereon, yea with paying for it in their purse and persons, in case they will not consent unto it (as some others of your partie have done) be not a <hi>pressing</hi> of them unto it, we leave unto men, whose judgements are not wholly swallowed up in the gulf of Presbyterian zeal, to determine.</p>
               <p>To your eight Reason, we answer, that we find very little heart <note place="margin">His eight Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> or face, of Reason in it. The strength of it (whatever it is) lies in this hypotheticall proposition: If it be <hi>against the nature of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints to live in sects apart, without communicating at the Lords table,</hi> then ought not the Apologists to be tolerated. But, &amp;c. But good <hi>A. S.</hi> do you conceive the men would under a Toleration, live without communicating at the Lords table? I know not what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion you have with their intentions or spirits, more then I: but for the present, I am no man of your beleif herein. Toleration or no Toleration, I beleeve they will communicate at the Lords table, and that other then twice a yeer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if living <hi>in Sects apart</hi> be so offensive to your zeal over <hi>the communion of Saints,</hi> why do you not rather mediate a Toleration for them, then oppose it? If you shall suffer them to work with you, they will be so much the more free to eat and drink with you, and to exercise all manner of Christian friendship and familiaritie with you. But if you shall thrust them into holes and corners, and judge them unworthy of all part and fellowship with you in the publique ministerie of the Gospel; you impose little lesse then a necessitie upon them <hi>to live apart,</hi> and to enjoy themselves amongst themselves; and besides represent your selves unto them as no wayes desirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them. Therefore in this Reason your premisses and conclusion are at utter defiance the one against the other.</p>
               <p>As for your ninth Reason, it is every whit as wilde, and wide <note place="margin">His 9. Reason answered.</note> from the purpose, as the former. For what if <hi>the Scripture exhorts us</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:196665:50"/>
                  <hi>ever more unto unitie,</hi> and this unitie <hi>cannot be easily procured by a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sects,</hi> doth it therefore follow, that godly, learned and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox men, such as being encouraged though at an under-rate, are (as was formerly shewed) both able and likely to do as good service against <hi>Sects</hi> as any men, are to be barr-hoysted, quash'd, crush'd, onely because they cannot say, a vision, where other men say it? The Scripture exhorts unto many things, which are not to be procured by every thing that is lawfull, no nor yet by every thing that is otherwise necessarie and fitting to be done. Were not this a ridiculous reasoning, The Scripture exhorts to <hi>live godlily in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world;</hi> but this cannot be procured by eating and drinking. Therefore eating and drinking are not to be tolerated. <hi>Apagè cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entas nugas!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas you adde, that <hi>a Toleration of Sects, cannot but daily beget new Schismes and Divisions.</hi> We answer, first, that this Allegation we have answered alreadie once and again: yet secondly, we adde, that many inconveniences, sicknesses, diseases come by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet are these to be tolerated in the world. Thirdly, we plead for no Toleration of any Sect, (nor of any thing so called) but which may stand with the utmost that either <hi>A. S.</hi> with his pen, or his whole partie with theirs, can do against them to suppresse them. Fourthly, we have formerly prov'd, that Apologisme is neither Sect, nor Schisme, more then <hi>A.</hi> S sisme is. Fiftly (and lastly) whereas you say, that <hi>a Toleration of Sects cannot but daily beget new schisme, &amp;c.</hi> We answer, first, that Gods toleration <hi>or long suffering</hi> towards sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, doth not onely <hi>lead</hi> all sinners <hi>to repentance,</hi> but also bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereunto. And why should not mans toleration expect an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect answerable hereunto? Secondly, the disciples in the ship were as much afraid, that their deare Lord and Master had been a foule spirit, and would have sunk them in the Sea, as <hi>A. S.</hi> is afraid of a Toleration, that it must needs beget new schismes and divisions daily. But as the feared Destroyer proved the experienced Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of that ship and men; so may <hi>A. S.</hi> his feared Propagator of <hi>Schismes and Divisions,</hi> be found an experienced destroyer and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of them. That means of all other which hath God in it, is likest to do the deed; and God (we know) was neither in the tempest, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but in the still voice.</p>
               <p>His tenth Reason, being help'd, riseth up in this form. If <hi>there was</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His 10 Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note>
                  <hi>a greater difference amongst the members as the Church of Corinth in the time of St. Paul, and yet they communicated together;</hi> and that by the <hi>Apostles</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:196665:50"/>
                  <hi>exhortation,</hi> then ought not the Apologists to be tolerated. But true is the former, therefore the latter also. We answer, first, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of your Argument is built upon a false foundation or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Reason why, the Apologists refuse communion with you, (you mean I suppose, in your sacramentall actions) is, because of the latitude, weight or degree of the differences in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between you and them: whereas the reason of their refusall in this kind, is the nature or particularity of the difference, together with your practise depending upon your opinion in opposition unto theirs, not the height, weight, or importance of either. A difference in judgement about the lawfulnesse of stinted forms of prayer, is nothing so materiall or weightie, as a difference about the nature of Faith, Justification, &amp;c. yet the lighter difference in this case, makes persons so differing, uncapable of joyning together in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in the use of such prayers; whereas the greater difference would not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there were so many and great <hi>differences amongst the members of the Church of Corinth,</hi> as you speak of, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> no waies perswaded or incouraged the predominant or major partie amongst them, either to cast out, cut off, or suppresse, the underling parties, but <hi>exhorted them unto mutuall communion,</hi> &amp;c. why do not you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your self with the line of the same processe, and instead of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing, quashing, crushing, trampling on, onely exhort the sects and schismes amongst you unto <hi>mutuall communion?</hi> and to the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of Sects and Divisions;</hi> a practise which you do well to take notice of in the Apostle, but do ill to think that your own of club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law is better.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and lastly) nor do we know any ground or good bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome you have for your assumption, wherein you affirm, that <hi>there was greater difference amongst the members of the Church of Corinth,</hi> then is between the Apologists and you. Old <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> is made to carrie this burthen alone.</p>
               <p>Your eleventh Reason is verie corpulent, but lesse active; the chief <note place="margin">His 11 Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> ingredients of it being <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors, Convents</hi> and <hi>Monasteries amongst the Papists, St. Francis, St. Dominick,</hi> and <hi>the Donatists,</hi> with whose opinion and practise, you say, the <hi>opinion of your Brethren too much symbolizeth.</hi> We answer, first, that <hi>Theologia symbolica non est ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentativa.</hi> Angels and Divels agree in something: yet this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no impeachment either to the holinesse or happinesse of the Angels. <hi>A. S.</hi> himself symbolizeth with <hi>Nestorius</hi> the heretique
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:196665:51"/> in one propertie; of whom <hi>Vincentius Lerinencis</hi> reporteth, that <hi>to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qui ut uni haeresi suae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum patefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret, cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum hoereseon blasphemias insectabatur. Vincent. Ler. cap.</hi> 16.</note>
                  <hi>make way for his own heresie</hi> [or opinion] <hi>he fell heavie upon all heresies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</hi> Secondly, whereas he affirmeth, that <hi>the opinion of his Brethren is not unlike to the Convents and Monasteries amongst the Papists;</hi> certainly the unlikenesse between them is farre greater, then that between an aple and an oyster. We cannot but wonder, how or in what respect, the man should conceive, that an inward, spirituall and notion all thing, as an opinion is, should be like a great building made of lime and stone, or a pack of idle fellows in a fat fraternity. Thirdly, whereas he insinuates an hatefull similitude between his <hi>Brethren</hi> and the <hi>Donatists, who</hi> (he tels us) <hi>separated themselves from other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, under pretext, that they were not so holy as their own;</hi> We answer, first, that this insinuation will not so much as in shew touch all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists however, because some of them (we beleeve) have <hi>no Churches of their own;</hi> and therefore they cannot pretend more holinesse in them, then in others. Secondly, that neither in substance or truth doth it touch any of them, or their opinion. For, first, they do not seperate from other Churches, but onely in such opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises wherein they cannot get leave of their consciences to joyne with them; the one half (at least) of which separation, is made even amongst their Churches themselves, one from another; one dissenting from another not onely in many opinions, but in some materiall practises (as before was touch'd, and that from <hi>A. S.</hi> his own pen, no waies partiall you may think in such a case.) Secondly, we would know, whether <hi>A. S.</hi> himself and his partie, doth not as much <hi>symbolize with the Donatists</hi> in that criticall propertie or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise we speak of, as the Apologists. For under what pretext do they separate from the Church of Rome and from Episcopall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but onely this, that they think <hi>not their Churches, to be as holy as their own.</hi> If they separate from them upon any other grounds, it were not much materiall though they held communion with them still. Yea thirdly, if they do not think their Presbyteriall Churches <hi>more holy</hi> then the Congregationall, they are farre more guiltie of Schisme and Separation, then their Brethren here spoken of. For then they are at libertie in point of conscience, to come over and joyn with them; when as the other are in bands and fetters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and cannot passe unto them. Their Brethren would gladly come over unto them, but cannot: they can come over unto these but will not. It is the will, not the act, that makes Schisme and Separation. Fourthly, we do not see, as deep as you have laid the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:196665:51"/> charge, wherein the Apologists do any whit more symbolize with Covents, Monasteries, or Orders, amongst the Papists, then you and your friends. You tell them, that <hi>all their Churches beleeve one Doctrine together with you, and that every one of these Churches hath one Minister, as the</hi> Popish <hi>Convents a particular Abbot or Prior.</hi> We pray you, do not <hi>all your Churches beleeve one Doctrine together? and hath not every one of your Churches one Minister?</hi> Wherein then lies the difference between you and them? or wherein do they symbolize more with Convents or Monasteries, then your self? Nay, (fifthly and lastly) as if you had quite forgotten your rhomb, you tacitely couple your self with those Popish Convents, Monasteries, and Orders, in one ignoble consideration, from which you acquit your Brethren. <hi>They onely differ</hi> (say you to them) <hi>in this, that ye have no Generall, or any thing answerable thereunto, to keep you in unitie and conformitie;</hi> plainly implying, that your Presbyterians have, <hi>viz.</hi> their soveraigne Judicatory. So that if this your reason should but take place, and be held valid, it is your Presbyterian partie, not the partie Apologizing, that ought to suffer the non-toleration you speak of; it being they, not these, that are the great symbolizers, with St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and St. <hi>Dominick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To your twelfth Reason, we have given answer upon answer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; <note place="margin">His 12. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note> as first, where we considered of the <hi>examples of the Kings of Judah,</hi> and shewed how little they contribute to the claime of <hi>cocr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power</hi> in the Magistrate, to take away heresies, schismes, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, &amp;c. Secondly, where we argued against such a power by severall demonstrations. Thirdly, where we gave an account also, how Toleration is no way either to Schisme, heresie, &amp;c. So that there is not one <hi>apex</hi> or <hi>iota</hi> of this Reason remaining unanswered.</p>
               <p>The Logico-Divinitie of your thirteenth Reason, consisteth in this <note place="margin">His 13. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note> Enthymeme, <hi>If we have but one God, one Christ, and one Lord, one Spirit, one Faith, one Baptisme, (whereby we enter into the Church) and are one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, we ought to have one Communion, whereby to be spiritually fed,</hi> and <hi>one Discipline to be ruled by:</hi> and if so, then ought not the Apologists to be tolerated. We answer, that neither doth your inference or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion here at all follow from your premisses. We have all you speak of, one, one, and one; and in regard of that multiplied unitie, <hi>we ought</hi> (as you say) <hi>to have one Communion, and one Discipline;</hi> But first, not necessarily that <hi>Communion,</hi> or <hi>that Discipline,</hi> which are of Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique inspiration, no more then those which are either of Papall, or Episcopall recommendation; because though we judge these two latter spirits more sphalmaticall, erroneous and dangerous then
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:196665:52"/> the first, yet we cannot think that either the Pope or Bishops, or both together, have so ing rossed the spirit of errour and fallibitie, but that they have left of that anointing more then enough to initiate all other orders, societies, and professions of men in the world. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though we <hi>ought to have one Communion and Discipline,</hi> yet ought we to be led into this unitie, by the hand of an Angel of light, not to be frighted into it by an evill Angel of fear and terror. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that dutie which lies upon all Christians, to have but <hi>one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Discipline</hi> amongst them, is no dispensation unto any partie or number of them, to smite their Brethren with the fist of uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, or to dismount them from their ministeriall standings in the Church, because they will not, or rather cannot, knit and joyn in the same Communion &amp; Discipline with them. Nay, fourthly, that verie tye of dutie which lies upon all Christians <hi>to have but one</hi> and the same <hi>Communion and Discipline</hi> amongst them, carries this ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them all along with it, to shew all love, to use all manner of gentlenesse and long suffering towards those that are contrarie minded to them either in the one or in the other, since love is not onely a sodering and uniting affection, but further commends the person in whom it is found, as one to whom God hath appeared, and who hath been taught by him. Therefore fifthly (and lastly) to make the ingagement that lies upon all Christians to <hi>have but one Communion and Discipline,</hi> a ground and reason why such as differ from others about these, should be evill intreated, suppressed, kept under hatches, or the like, is as if a man should plead that naturall affection which a parent ow's unto his children, for a ground and motive why he should sharply scourge them when they are sick and weak.</p>
               <p>His fourteenth Reason is of an unknown strength (at least to me) <note place="margin">His 14 Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> If I were a Magistrate, I should never the more know how to prepare to battell against the Apologists or any other godly person, for the sound of this trumpet. Surely of all the rest, this Reason will never be accessarie to the undoing of these men. However, let a poore man be heard in his cause. The Reason then with all the help it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, riseth up but thus. <hi>If Churches have Disciplines or Governments different in their species, then the Churches must be different in their species also. But the consequent is false,</hi> since there is but one Church: <hi>Ergo</hi> Apologisme is intolerable. They that can gather this conclusion out of the premisses, may very well hope <hi>to gather grapes of thorns, and figs of thistles.</hi> The consequent in this argument, which the Disputer
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:196665:52"/> saith is false, is this, <hi>Churches must be different in their species.</hi> If the meaning of this <hi>consequent</hi> be, that there is an absolute necessitie, that Churches should <hi>differ specie</hi> one from another, the disputant is in the truth, in saying the consequent is false. Or if the meaning be, that Churches ought to <hi>differ specie</hi> one from another, the same ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict may still passe upon it. But upon that supposition which is made in the Antecedent of this argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that these Churches <hi>have Disciplines or Governments different in their species,</hi> the <hi>consequent</hi> is not onely <hi>true,</hi> but necessarily true: and that upon the Disputants own ground, which is, that <hi>all collective bodies that are governed, are differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> (specie) <hi>by their different governments.</hi> But be the Consequent, or be the Antecedent, or be the consequence, be any thing be nothing, or be every thing in the premisses, either true or false, why should not the Apologists be tolerated notwithstanding? Be the Sunne in <hi>Aries,</hi> or be it in <hi>Taurus,</hi> or be it in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> why should not <hi>A. S.</hi> be tolerated to write more books for the cause Presbyterian notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? I hear that upon the applause and approbation of this by his partie, he hath since put forth his hand to another, as <hi>Herod</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Act. 12. 2, 3.</note> that his butcherie upon <hi>James, pleased the people, put forth his hand to take Peter also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is there nothing more in the Reason then this? Truly if <hi>A. S.</hi> hides the theasure of his mind so deepe another time, digg for it who will for me. For this once I have taken paines to finde it; and have found somewhat which I concive is like to it, if not Identically it. The man (I take it) would be here conceived to reason after this manner. <hi>If the Church of Christ ought to be ruled or Governed, only with one species or kinde of government, then ought not they to be suffered, who goe about to pluralize this government, or to set up a kind of government in the Church, specifically differing from the government more generally practised and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sed verum prius: ergo &amp; posterius:</hi> and consequently the Apologists being men that would doe such a thing as this, are not to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If this be the Argument, this is the Answer. First, the consequence is lame, and halts right downe; because though the Church of Christ ought to be governed with one and the same kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughout the world, yet it no wayes followes, from hence, that therefore that government which is more generally established and practised in the world, should be that specificall Government whereby it ought to be governed. If this consequence were good, it would highly befreind the Government Pontifician, but dissolve and destroy the Government Presbyterian; because the Pontifican Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:196665:53"/> is (or at least not long since was) far more Oecumenicall, and comprehensive, then the Presbyterian either is, or is like to be. Therefore in framing this consequence, the man hath given sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against himselfe and his owne beloved opinion touching Church-Discipline; and hath put a sword into the Popes hand to smite as well the Consistorian, as the Congregationall Government. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, suppose the Government more generally practised in the world, be that very kind of Government, wherby the Churches of Christ ought to be governed, yet except this Government both as touching the lawfulnesse and necessitie of it, be sufficiently cleered to the judgments and consciences of those, from whom submission to it is required, (an honour whereunto <hi>A. S.</hi> his Government hath not yet been preferred by all his great freinds) they ought not to be scourged with his scorpions, if they demurre a while about their submission thereunto; and in the meane season, desire to live under such a Government, wherin they have double and treble satisfaction both in point of lawfulnesse and necessity, above the other. Thirdly and lastly, though unity and uniformity in Government be very fitting and necessary throughout the Churches of Christ, yet that the servants of Christ should fall foule one upon another, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eate up the lesse for this uniformity sake, is no wayes necessarie; especially considering that God (as hath been formerly shewed) hath provided other means farre more gracious, honourable and proper, for the bringing of the blessednesse of this uniformitie upon his Churches in due time. So that if there be any thing in this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it is altogether with, and not at all against the Apologists.</p>
               <p>To your fifteenth, we answer, first, be it supposed, (which yet we <note place="margin">His 15. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> shall presently oppose) that <hi>neither Christ, nor his Apostles ever granted any toleration to divers Sects and Governments in the Church;</hi> yet did he or they ever grant a power to a major part of professors in a Kingdom or Nation, to grind the faces of their Brethren <hi>partakers of like precious faith</hi> and holinesse with them, either because they could not in all points jump with them in their judgements, or because they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to keep a good conscience towards God, for following the ducture and guidance of their present light? If you will <hi>take with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking that,</hi> which <hi>neither Christ nor his Apostles ever granted</hi> you, you may verie well bear it at the hands of your Brethren, if they humbly <hi>sue</hi> and intreat for what they never granted; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that that which you <hi>take</hi> is imperious and high, tending
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:196665:53"/> to the annoyance and trouble of many; whereas that which they <hi>sue</hi> for, is moderate and lowe, onely a peaceable standing amongst you, that they may be able to do good unto many. Secondly, if <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ nor his Apostles</hi> (as you say) <hi>ever granted any toleration to divers Sects and Governments in his Church,</hi> how come you and your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>tolerated,</hi> your Government being specifically diversified from that of the Papacie (as is before observed) which is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and extensive then yours? If you have not a toleration for your Government, either from Christ or his Apostles, we are doubtfull from whom, or whence you have it? Thirdly, do you not by this reason build up the wals of Babylon, and strengthen the Papists in their bloodie errour, against the reformed Churches, upon which they look as schismaticall from their Mother, and in that respect think them no wayes fit to be <hi>tolerated,</hi> but to be suppressed both in their Doctrine and Government, yea and in case they will not be reduced to the principles of Rome, to be wholly extirpated and rooted out of the world? What can be spoken more to the heart of such apprehensions, and counsels and resolutions as these, then that <hi>neither Christ nor his Apostles ever granted any toleration to divers Sects and Governments in the Church?</hi> Fourthly, whereas you say, that they <hi>granted no toleration to divers Sects,</hi> do you not imply, that they did grant a toleration to some <hi>one Sect</hi> at least, if not to more. And how know you whether the <hi>Sect</hi> of Apologisme (in your improperating stile) be not that Sect, or one of those Sects, to which Christ and his Apostles (it seems) granted a toleration? Is it not (I appeal to your judgement and conscience) as like to be this as any other? Fiftly, we willingly grant your conclusion in this Reason, <hi>sensu sano;</hi> that there is no reason why the Apologists should <hi>sue for a Toleration,</hi> no nor yet properly, why they should be <hi>tolerated, (toleration</hi> in proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of signification, as was formerly noted, being <hi>rei malae,</hi> appliable onely to that which is evill) but rather why they should be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and incouraged. Therefore if you think that they shall sin in <hi>suing for a toleration,</hi> you shall do well to prevent that sin in them (and perhaps shall withall prevent a greater of your own) by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them persons worthy not of a <hi>Toleration,</hi> but of incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or at least by procuring them a Toleration, that they may not be put upon the tentation of suing for it. But sixtly and lastly, to the main frame of your Reason: what do you think of, <hi>Sinite utrunque crescere, Let both grow together untill the harvest.</hi> Matth. 13. 30. Is not here the <hi>toleration granted,</hi> which you deny to be <hi>granted? Non</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:196665:54"/>
                  <hi>lac lacti, nec ovum ovo similius;</hi> If it be not this <hi>Toleration,</hi> certainly it is somewhat as like to it, as like may be. You know who the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder is, that gave this order, laid this restraint upon his servants; otherwise the 37. verse will inform you. And who do you think should be meant, by <hi>the tares?</hi> You will not say, the good sons of the Church, at least so acknowledged by their Mother. You cannot say (with reason) the loose, vicious, &amp;c. morally disordered sons of the Church, because these were sown in the field, before the <hi>Housholder sew that good seed</hi> therein (spoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 24. and 38.) whereas <hi>the tares,</hi> which must be let <hi>grow to the harvest,</hi> are expresly said to have been sown after, <hi>v.</hi> 25. And besides such wicked and vicious persons as these, at least as the danger and degree of their wickednesse may be, ought to be gathered out of the State (and then they cannot <hi>grow in the field till harvest)</hi> by the hand of the Civill Magistrate. Therefore thirdly (and lastly) you must by <hi>the tares,</hi> of necessitie understand, such in the Church, as you call <hi>Sectaries, Schismatiques, Heretiques,</hi> such as corrupt the puritie of the Doctrine of the Gospel, by erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and false opinions, or at least are look'd upon by the greater part of the respective Churches of Christ, as such. Which yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further, by the reason which the Housholder renders unto his servants, why he would not have them pluck'd up, but grow untill the harvest: <hi>least</hi> (saith he) <hi>whilest ye go about to gather the tares, ye pluck up the wheat also.</hi> There is no danger of hurting or plucking up the wheat, 1. the children of the Kingdom, <hi>v.</hi> 38. by punishing civill or morall misdemeanors of men; but if Magistrates or others shall be busie about plucking up Sectaries, Heretiques, &amp;c. they will be in continuall danger <hi>of plucking up the wheat.</hi> First, because many truly pious and conscientious men, <hi>children of the Kingdom,</hi> may soon be drawn in to some unwarrantable sect and opinion: and secondly, such opinions as are sentenced by the generalitie or major part of a Church, as erronious or hereticall, and so expose those that hold them to the reproachfull names, of sectaries, schismatiques, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, verie often fall out to be the sacred truths of God, and the persons holding them forth unto the world, the best and faithfullest of his servants.</p>
               <p>For your sixteenth Reason, it concerneth others, more then the Apologists, to answer; the frame of it being an indignabund rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">His 16. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> (whether true or no, <hi>caveat Lector)</hi> of what hard measure the New-Englanders offered to some that desired to sit down amongst them, <hi>because they differed a little from them in point of Discipline.</hi> The
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:196665:54"/> men here charged, are of age to speak for themselves; and besides, want no abilities otherwise. I make no question, but if they had but the correcting of <hi>A. S.</hi> his Relation, they would be able to make more reason and equity of it, then without some correction or other, I am able to do. But (to leave our Brethren in New-England to their own Apologie) I would fain know of <hi>A. S.</hi> what he means to do with his storie; or how he intends to bring it under contribution to his cause. For first, he doth not onely not approve of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, which he relateth, but is very passionate and intemperate in the very relation.</p>
               <q>Delicti fies idem reprehensor, &amp; Author?</q>
               <p>Is the man so full of the spirit of reprehension against such practises, and yet so full of the spirit of imitation also? Or what? is his desire so great, to appropriate or ingrosse the power and practise of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting for difference in Religion, to himself and his own partie, that he is not able patiently to bear the sight of either in others? If your Brethren in New-England stumbled at the stone you speak of, <hi>persecuted</hi> (as yov say) those that <hi>were approved by themselves both for their life and Doctrine, meerly because they differed a little from them in point of Discipline,</hi> you have a faire warning; take heed that you do not stumble at the same stone also. They (it's like) justified themselves in themselves, in those proceedings, though they did not so in the sight of God; but if you, having condemned them in what they did, shall neverthelesse run the same course, you will be both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> both self-condemned, and God-condemned also, and so have no cloak nor shelter for your sin.</p>
               <p>But you think it no wayes reasonable, that the Apologists, being of the <hi>same profession</hi> (as you speak) <hi>should be suiters for a Toleration in old England.</hi> We answer, first, if you speak with reference to those proceedings immediately before reported by you, you are more of the <hi>same profession</hi> with them, then your Brethren the Apologists. These do not professe persecution <hi>meerly for a little difference in point of Discipline;</hi> the world knows who they are that do little lesse. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what though men of the same <hi>profession</hi> with them, miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of such light, as should have directed them in a better way; must this be a band of conscience upon them, to <hi>bowe down their backs</hi> without any more ado, and to suffer Presbyterian Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to <hi>go over them, as the stones in the street?</hi> Nay, thirdly, they have the more reason and necessitie, in regard of such a miscarriage of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:196665:55"/> their Brethren, <hi>to sue for a Toleration</hi> here; because by that miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of theirs, they are awakened to expect and fear yet far harder measure from you and your partie, if they do not bestir themselves by some means or other to prevent it. He that feels the smart of rods to be grievous, hath the more reason, not the lesse, to take heed of being beaten with scorpions. Fourthly (and lastly) why should you any wayes be against your Brethren suing for a Toleration, when as there lies a necessitie upon you to grant it or consent to it, unlesse you mean to steere that New-England course, which you have with so high a hand of indignation contested with, in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Reason. Except (haply) you have this ingenuous reach in it, for your reputations, that you would <hi>honestis precibus occurrere,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all honest and reasonable requests with the early forwardnesse of your bountie. If I could reasonably think this to be your designe, I would seriously perswade with the Apologists to wave their suit for a Toleration, and so to gratifie you with an honourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of doing good, before you were provoked by any mans suit or motion to it.</p>
               <p>But men that are subject to fears, are seldome sons of bountie. The bottome (it seems) of all that <hi>A. S.</hi> hath pleaded throughout his Discourse, against the Toleration of Apologisme, is a solemn <hi>fear</hi> that possesseth him of being <hi>sent</hi> he and <hi>all</hi> his partie <hi>into some Isle of Dogs,</hi> if the Congregationall men <hi>had</hi> but <hi>the upper hand over them. Omne timidum, natura querulum.</hi> But, I can hardly beleeve that the man is really afraid of what he here pretendeth; (in which case he were rather to be pitied, then roundly dealt with) first, because him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesseth, that some of <hi>his Brethren</hi> hold, that <hi>all sects and opinions</hi> are to be <hi>tolerated,</hi> p. 62. So that in case these men should have the upper hand, he is assured of a partie at least among them, to secure him and his in that kind. Secondly, he confesseth again and again, that his Brethren are <hi>very pious and holy men;</hi> and therefore certainly will not be so dogged, as to send him and his into any <hi>Isle of Dogs.</hi> Thirdly, a poore Toleration is as farre from a superioritie of power, as rags are from the robe, or the dunghill from the throne. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I do not think that he knows any such Isle as he speaks of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he fears to be sent by the men of his indignation. Fiftly, and lastly, if he should be sent into some <hi>Isle of Dogs,</hi> the soyl and climate might probably agree well with him; he hath learned (it seems) to bark and bite too, against his sending thither.</p>
               <p>To conclude, for this Reason: whereas feare indeed ordinarily
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:196665:55"/> makes men cruell, it is much to be feared, <hi>A. S.</hi> only pretends feare, that so he may have a colour to be cruell.</p>
               <p>To his 17<seg rend="sup">th.</seg> Reason, we Answer. First that the <hi>Scripture doth not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His 17. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note>
                  <hi>forbid, all,</hi> nor any <hi>such Toleration,</hi> as the Apologists desire. This was sufficiently shewed before in our Answer to the fifteenth Reason. His proofe from Revel. 2. 20. holds no intelligence at all with his purpose; yea it makes sore against himselfe and his Synedrion. For first by the toleration or <hi>suffering of Iezabel,</hi> which is there charged as a finfull neglect, upon the Church of Thyatira, is not meant a civill or state Toleration, but an Ecclesiastique or Church toleration. This Church suffered false Doctrines to be taught in her very bosome, and her members to be corrupted and endangered thereby, from day to day, without laying it to heart (being a matter of that sad consequence) and without calling those to an accompt that were the sowers of such teares, broachers and spreaders of such opinions; yea without using any meanes, to have the truth soundly taught in opposition to such Doctrines. Both Pastor and people (it seemes) <hi>slept</hi> together, whilst the <hi>envious man,</hi> by his Agent and factresse Iezabel, <hi>sowed these tares</hi> in their field. Such a Toleration as this we formerly shewed to be sinfull; and the Apologists are as much against it as you; so farre are they from desiring it, or sueing for it. They desire a Toleration for themselves and their Churches in the civill state; not that the errours which spring up in their Churches, should be suffered to fret like gangrens, without being opposed by them, or be protected by the State. Secondly whereas that particular Church alone is charged by Christ, with this toleration or <hi>sufferance of Iezabell,</hi> and not any more Churches, whether neighbors or not neighbors to his, nor any <hi>combined Eldership,</hi> or <hi>state Ecclesiasticall,</hi> made of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation of the seven Churches, much lesse any state civill, evident it is that the care and power of redressing emergeing enormites or evills in a Church in every kind, is committed by Christ to every particular Church respectively, within in it selfe. And so <hi>they that trouble the Church</hi> must (as you say) <hi>be cut off.</hi> But by whom? not by the civill magistrate (if the trouble be spirituall) nor by the combined Eldership, but by the particular Church it selfe, which is troubled by them, in case there be no remedy otherwise. Secondly when you say, that <hi>there must be no such speeches among vs, as I am of Paul, I of Apollo's</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor that some are Calvinians, some Independenters, some Brownists</hi> &amp;c. and againe <hi>that we must all be Christs, we must all think and speak the same thing, otherwise men are carnall</hi> &amp;c. (with some other good words to

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:196665:57"/> like purpose) we joyn heart and hand with you in all these things, and are readie to contribute the best of our endeavours, unto yours, if ye will suffer us, to make the <hi>tabernacle</hi> of God amongst us <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this pattern</hi> which you shew unto us. Such expressions, <hi>I am of Paul, I of Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. together with the names of <hi>Calvinians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Brownists,</hi> &amp;c. are as untuneable in our eares, as in yours, &amp;c. But,</p>
               <p>First, every man that saith, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> or, <hi>I am of Apollos,</hi> is not to be taught by <hi>thorns and briars,</hi> (as <hi>Gedeon</hi> taught the men of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth) to speak better, by fineing, imprisonning, unchurching, or the like; but by soundnesse of conviction, and wholesomnesse of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from the word of God. The Germans have a saying, that <hi>etiam in latrone puniendo potest peccari;</hi> A may may sin in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing him that most of all deserves it. It is not enough for us to correspond with God in his ends, but we must keep as close to him in his means also. Secondly, whereas you say, <hi>we must all be Christs;</hi> surely there is none of those Sects you speak of, but are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to joyn with you in being his, and in being called by his Name, rather then by any other. We fear, these unhappie sounds, of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Brownists, Anabaptists,</hi> &amp;c. are more frequently made of your breath, then of the breath of any other sort, or sect of men amongst us. Thirdly, whereas you adde, <hi>Neither hath the Church of God a custome to be contentious;</hi> the Apostle indeed saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>that the Churches of God have no such custome;</hi> but he doth not say, that these <hi>Churches of God</hi> had any custome, to erect a Presbyterian throne, or <hi>a combined eldership</hi> amongst them, to keep them from contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Fourthly, whereas you tell us, that <hi>neither permitteth the Apostle Schismes;</hi> we tell you, that we have already told you (and that once and again) both in what sence he permitteth them, and in what not, and have shewed you our concurrence with him in both. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and lastly) in that you tell us, that <hi>we must not quit our mutuall meetings, as others do, and as must</hi> (you say) <hi>be done in a publique Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we neither well understand the sence of your words, much lesse any purport in them to your purpose. We do not know what <hi>quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of <hi>meetings</hi> there is like to be more under a <hi>publique toleration,</hi> then is for the present.</p>
               <p>Your eighteenth Reason is so Atheologicall, and unworthie your <note place="margin">His 18 Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> cause, that the very naming of it might be Answer sufficient. <hi>A tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> (you say) <hi>cannot but expose your Churches unto the calumnies of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who evermore object unto Protestants the innumerable number of these</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:196665:57"/>
                  <hi>Sects, whereas they pretend to be nothing but one Church.</hi> Will you redeem your self out of the hand of Popish calumnies, by symbolizing with them? will you turn Turk, that you may not suffer Turkish inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and thraldome? Surely you forget your argument insisted upon in your eleventh Reason: There you make <hi>symbolizing</hi> with Papists, a reason against your Brethren and their Opinion, why they should not be tolerated; and here you make a defect or want in them of symbolizing with them, a reason likewise why they should not be tolerated. It seems contradictions, inconsistencies, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, unintelligibilities, sence, non-sence, any thing, nothing, will serve to make reasons against the poore Independenters (as you call them) why they must not be tolerated. Was not the consideration of your own, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>that the Devill evermore assaults more the true Church, the true Doctrine, and true Discipline, then the corrupted Church, her corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrine or Discipline,</hi> a farre better sanctuarie for your Churches against those Popish calumnies you speak of, then a correspondence with them, <hi>to keep you in unitie and conformitie?</hi> But this Reason we have answered formerly.</p>
               <p>Your ninteenth Reason, is very concise. In this you onely say, <note place="margin">His 19. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son answered.</note> that <hi>of such a Toleration follows all you formerly deduced out of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> And so it may without putting the world to much damage, or sorrow. When we cast up your <hi>deductions</hi> of inconveniences <hi>out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie,</hi> we found them counterballanced to the height with the exits from Presbytery. If you poyse your wallet wel, you wil the end that hangs at your back the heavier. But for Answer to this Reason, I refer the Reader to the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>His twentieth Reason, is somewhat of a differing strein from the <note place="margin">His 20. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note> rest. The ground and bottome of it seems to be, a desire of a plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble insinuation with the Assembly, under a pretence of jealousie over them, lest they should suffer in point of honour, in case his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren should obtain a Toleration. But first, good <hi>A. S.</hi> why must it needs be thought, in case <hi>it should be granted</hi> unto them, <hi>that it was extorted by force of Reason,</hi> or <hi>that all the Assembly were not âble to answer your Brethren?</hi> This suggestion smels of worse blood about the heart, then all the Reasons hitherto; Fearing (it seems) that all ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Assembly in point of conscience to deny the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists a Toleration, might fail, and prove ineffectuall that way; he seeks here to ingage them in point of honour, by way of reserve; telling them (in effect) that howsoever their consciences might fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Independenters in point of Toleration, yet their credits and reputations would suffer by it. Yet let the suggestion be but a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:196665:58"/> little look'd into, and it will be found to reflect no great matter of grace or commendation upon the Assembly it self. For if no favour or courtesie can be <hi>thought</hi> to come from them, but that which is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by reason,</hi> and the deniall whereof they <hi>cannot answer,</hi> it is a signe that they are not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  </gap>. <hi>i. easie to be intreated, fall of mercie and good fruits,</hi> which yet the holy Ghost makes the standing characters of <hi>that wisdom which is from above.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whereas he addes, <hi>that their opinion and demands are against all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and that <hi>sundry of them could not deny</hi> as much, <hi>and had nothing to say, but that it was Gods Ordinance.</hi> We answer, first, that, what <hi>A. S.</hi> his standart is whereby he measures <hi>reason,</hi> we are not so well acquainted with him, as to know; but according to ours, this assertion of his opens seven times wider <hi>against all reason,</hi> then either the <hi>opinion</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> of his Antagonists. First, for their opinion, we believe that somewhat more then non-sense or irrationalities, hath been argued by themselves in the Assembly for it: Is it like, <hi>that very learned men, and of abilities to dispute their opinion in any Assembly in Europe</hi> (which are <hi>A. S.</hi> owne letters of recommendation on their behalf) should rise up to defend an opinion that is contrary <hi>to all reason?</hi> And somewhat like unto reason (at least so called, amongst our vulgar apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) hath bin said for it in the preceding part of this Discourse. And secondly, for their Demands; though <hi>A. S.</hi> doth not inform us what they are, or wherein that fiery contestation <hi>against all reason,</hi> which he findes in them consists, yet we suppose, he means their <hi>sueing for a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> that high misdemeanor, for which he hath judged them now these ten times. Was it, or is it, or would it be <hi>against all reason,</hi> for the poor Protestant Churches in <hi>France,</hi> to sue for a <hi>Toleration</hi> in the state, if it were not granted unto them without sueing? Or is it not much more agreeable <hi>to reason,</hi> that Protestant Churches should be <hi>tolerated</hi> in a Protestant State, then in a State Pontificiall; especially in such a Protestant State, of which they have so eminently deserved, as the Apologists and their Churches, and men of their judgement have done of this, as was briefly touched in the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Or is it <hi>against all reason,</hi> that those persons in the low-countries between whose judgements there is that known variety of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in matters of Religion, and which concerne the worship of God, being not able so well to accommodate themselves for livelihood and subsistence in any other State, with the freedome of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, should desire a <hi>Toleration</hi> in that? Suppose those men of your judgement, of whom you speake, p. 10. who were (as you there say) <hi>condemned to death for their Discipline, ready to be executed, and were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:196665:58"/>
                  <hi>exiled into forraigne countries;</hi> Suppose (I say) these men had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired a <hi>Toleration</hi> in their own countrey, of those who thus unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably dealt with them, had they violated all Rules and Principles of <hi>Reason</hi> by such a desire? But the truth is, that the assertion is so notoriously <hi>against all reason,</hi> that it is scarce consistent with reason to bestow so much pen in answer to it. There is but one only suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make either reason or truth of it: if it be granted, it may passe for both. If the desires of some Presbyterians be <hi>All reason,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reason but they, then both the Opinion and Demands of the Apologists, must be acknowledged to be against all Reason. But otherwise I know no principle or rule of reason at all so much as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtefied by either.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas you say, that <hi>sundrie of themselves could not deny it, and had nothing to say, &amp;c.</hi> first, certain I am that some of them have absolutely denied any such confession. Secondly, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement it self looks no more like any of the rest, then a meer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth the Relator. I beleeve that upon inquirie it will be found a misprision of truth. For doth it not sound aloud incredibilitie, that men of sufficient <hi>abilities to dispute their opinion in any Assembly in Europe,</hi> should confesse their <hi>Opinion and Demands to be against all reason?</hi> But such stones as these are fit for <hi>A. S.</hi> his building.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas you say, that they <hi>could never shew</hi> (their opinion) <hi>out of Gods Word,</hi> we answer, that they have often <hi>shewed</hi> it; but God and men (it seems) are not yet agreed to have it so generally seen, as is to be desired: but our hope is, that the agreement will be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between them in due time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and lastly, you conclude this reason, with this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that <hi>if it</hi> (your brethens opinion we suppose you mean; though it's hard both here, and in twenty places more to know your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleerly) <hi>be refused, it will help to confirme the Churches and the people in truth.</hi> We desire to know <hi>in truth</hi> of what? It will indeed <hi>confirme</hi> both marvellously, in the truth of Presbyterian fastnesse to their owne cause; but in what other <hi>truth</hi> it should <hi>confirm</hi> either the one or the other, we wait for our intelligence from you to know.</p>
               <p>Your 21<seg rend="sup">th</seg> and last Reason (save onely those which you say you <note place="margin">His last Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Answered.</note>
                  <hi>omit)</hi> is but a slip of your nineteenth, being somewhat that follows out of Independency. But here you tell us, that the <hi>Government</hi> so <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, cannot but overthrow all sort of Ecclesiasticall Government; Is</hi> Saul <hi>also among the Prophets? Haec verba loquentis ab ore, Gaudens Arripio, &amp; sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefactus numine, adoro.</hi> I joy over these words, and reverence them for what I conceive to be of God in them. Wee know who prophefied,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:196665:59"/> when he was not aware of it. Indeed, by the beauty and perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy of this Government with the Word of God, it may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably (yea, and upon higher terms then of reason) be thought that in time, <hi>it cannot but overthrow all sort of Ecclesiasticall Government,</hi> and stand up it self in their stead. <hi>Faxit Deus, &amp; festinet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which you adde in the close of this Reason, plainly sheweth, that you had no mind to prophecie, though God had, or might have by you: for here you say, <hi>that this order by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will breed all sort of disorder.</hi> No, first it will not breed the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of oppressing consciencious men, for conscience sake: nor second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of discouraging men from searching the Scriptures more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; nor thirdly, of having recourse unto the world for the setting up of the Government of Christs Kingdome; nor fourthly, of making men walk sundry miles for what they might have upon as good or better terms at home, besides a thousand other <hi>disorders,</hi> which the <hi>order</hi> of your Independancy, <hi>will</hi> never breed by any consequence at all, <hi>necessary,</hi> or <hi>unnecessary,</hi> being of a very soveraigne importance to prevent them. And for your premisses (in the body of your Reason) by which you would fain make the match, between the <hi>order</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependancy, <hi>and all sort of disorder,</hi> they are but false brokers: The Independent Churches (as you all them) <hi>have no such custome,</hi> as for one to give intertainment or admission to any person, that hath been <hi>censured by another,</hi> without the censure first relaxed by that Church which inflicted it, or without the consent of this Church. This is their reproach, not their practice.</p>
               <p>And thus we see, that amongst <hi>A. S.</hi> his 21. <hi>Reasons,</hi> there is not one that will stand by their Master, when they are but a little put to it; there is none of them, but with a little perswasion and debate, will willingly enough consent to a <hi>Toleration</hi> for the <hi>Apologists.</hi> If the Disputant himself, with his party, were but as tractable as his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, then need no more words be made about the businesse.</p>
               <p>As for his after-birth of Reasons (p. 65.) since he professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that he <hi>omits them,</hi> we shall comport with him herein, and <hi>omit</hi> them also; I hope he will think himself a debtor to us for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance It seems that himself placeth no great confidence in them, in that he mentions them, as if he mentioned them not, and thought them not worthy to be numbred amongst his first-born. His <hi>Horsemen</hi> (you see) have bin overcome, and yeelded themselves: his <hi>Infantery</hi> knows the manner of the field, and will, no question, surrender with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incounter. Nor is there any thing for weight or substance in this <hi>Taile</hi> of Reasons, but what hath been broken already in the <hi>Head.</hi>
